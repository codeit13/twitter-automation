1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
पहली चीज तो यह थी कि मुझे पता ही नहीं था कहां मिलता है ये काम

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,000
Auditions होते कहां है

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,800
और जहां भी मैं पहुँचता था Auditions के लिए

4
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,760
पहले 150 लोग पहुँचे कैसे हैं वहाँ

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,960
ये है Vicky Kaushal's Introduction to the Podcasting World

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,440
आपको एक बहुत Intense Energy Feel होती है

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,320
Engineering Bro

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,720
The ability to reverse engineer is my biggest gift of engineering

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,920
बहुत मेहनत गई है यार

10
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,360
बहुत रगडाई हुई है यार

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,040
अब आपको चाहिए ये

12
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,640
अभी आपको पता नहीं है कैसे मिलेगा आपको

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,760
तो ये रिवर्स एंजिनिव कर दो

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,560
I'm sure you had some kind of a similar experience in media generally

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,480
अच्छा ये भी होता है

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,400
एक हीरो के करियर को लेकर

17
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,720
वो A to Z समझाई

18
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,800
ये जो तुमने फ्लो चार्ट बनाया है ना

19
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,760
क्या हिंदी फिल्म इंडस्ट्री में

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,280
एक नेटोर्किंग गेम खेलनी पड़ती है

21
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,760
Being a part of social gatherings

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,160
उसके वज़े से आपको काम मिल जाएगा कभी नहीं होगा

23
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,640
Katrina Kaif ने क्या आइट किया

24
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,760
आपके हिंदी फिल्म इंडस्ट्री

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,280
101 के फ्लो चार्ट में

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,280
एक silent masculine pain दिखाई देता है

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,260
आपके performances में

28
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,980
Imagine like there's a weight of 2000 kilos on your shoulder

29
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,400
Men in general are conditioned to kind of

30
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
suppress feelings and like

31
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,700
ठीक है यार होता है होता है

32
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,220
बस चल रहा है भाई

33
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,320
डर के आगे जीत है

34
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,780
Stories on TRS में आपका स्वागत है दोस्तों

35
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,520
आज के star of the show है

36
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,620
Vicky Kaushal भाई

37
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,920
जो हिंदी फिल्म इंडस्टरी के

38
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,860
एक चमचमाते सतार है और बहुत सारे

39
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:19,640
लोगों को इनके करियर के बार में

40
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,140
बहुत कुछ पता है इनके करियर के

41
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,900
trajectory के बार में बहुत कुछ पता है

42
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,940
बहुत कम लोगों को इनके

43
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,680
pre-career phase के बार में पता है

44
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,180
इनके engineering college phase के बारे में पता है

45
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,080
आज मैंने उस phase के बारे में ज्यादा बात करी

46
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,180
काफी ज्यादा intense conversation करी इनके साथ

47
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,220
इनकी psychology जानने के लिए

48
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,600
बहुत सारे लोग मानते हैं कि Vicky Kaushal has arrived

49
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,160
कुछ लोग कहते हैं कि he is the next big thing in the Hindi film industry

50
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,460
पर मैं मानता हूँ कि he has arrived

51
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,640
आज मैंने इनके दिल को जानने की कोशिश करी

52
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,880
इनके हिम्मत को जानने की कोशिश करी

53
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,840
क्योंकि यही है हमारी इस series की theme

54
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,880

बहुत अच्छा लग रहा हूँ आपसे बात करके

66
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,440
यह मैं काफी सारे लोगों को कहता हूँ

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,260
क्योंकि आजकल काफी सारे cool लोग आ रहे हैं शोपे

68
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,060
तो बहुत देश है

69
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,740
मुझे आपसे बात करना था

70
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,820
ने यार even I am very happy to be here

71
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,700
and also just to tell you की

72
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,220
बहुत कमाल काम कर रहे हो यार तुम और तुमारी पूरी team

73
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,280
because जो conversations

74
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,440
यहाँ पे मैंने सुनी है

75
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,960
and मैं कई बार मेरी आदत है की

76
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,220
cardio करते समय podcast लगा लो and everything

77
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,240
यहाँ पे मुझे conversations ना

78
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,580
अपने level की लगती है

79
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,860
मुझे समझ में भी आती है and it's more interactive

80
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,860
I don't know why I feel like हाँ यार मुझे

81
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,660
genuinely कुछ information मिल रही है

82
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,580
and just मज़ा भी आता it's not just information

83
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,420
but I'm very happy to be here

84
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,680
no we're happy to talk to you and personally I'm happy to talk to you

85
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,420
मैं भी आपकी तरह एक

86
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,940
engineering college grad हूँ

87
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,360
और अलग vibe feel होती है engineers के साथ

88
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,900
yeah I know

89
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,200
क्यूं यह क्यूं होता है

90
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,540
I don't know यार I think something that we go through

91
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,900
it's just very trauma

92
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,360
no I don't I wouldn't call it trauma because

93
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,280
actually for me those four years

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,380
in engineering have been like the most beautiful

95
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,320
four years of my life yeah yeah seriously

96
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:45,240
like I got some like lifelong

97
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,880
friends who are friends till date

98
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,140
I passed out in 2009

99
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,160
so अब कितने साल हो गए हैं

100
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,000
like those friendships like जो

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,620
2005 में बने थे first year में

102
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,900
from the queue of admission

103
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,380
form भरना और यह वो तब से दोस्ट बने हुए

104
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,600
and जो experience थे मुझे ऐसा लगा

105
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,200
like I became a boy to a man

106
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,380
during my engineering days and that I feel

107
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,240
that is one thing that happens to all

108
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,020
engineering students yeah I feel

109
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,440
it turns you into an adult

110
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,140
क्यूंकि आपको बहुत बार खुद को

111
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,940
बचाना पड़ता है engineering college में

112
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,680
assignment submission के time

113
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,860
जब आप professors के साथ जगड़े कर ले लगते हैं

114
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,960
हाँ आपको लगी थी कितनी

115
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,920
एक ही लगी थी but BW

116
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,840
basic engineering electronics first year में

117
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,340
BW में लगी थी मैं मुझे

118
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,460
दो लगी थी जिसमें से एक मैं

119
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,600
reval में पास हो गया था so it was mechanics

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,840
and CP

121
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,780
computers मेरे बिलकुल उपर से जाता था

122
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,740
हमेशा so

123
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,480
लो coding समझी ही नहीं

124
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,180
आज तक भी नहीं समझ

125
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,340
but KT

126
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,380
लगी थी मुझे and मैंने

127
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,760
अपने mom dad को बहुत prep किया था

128
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,240
KT मतलब back

129
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,840
मुंबई में इसे KT कहते है

130
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,200
आप fail हो गये एक सब बताईए

131
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,320
so मैंने अपने mom dad को

132
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,020
बहुत prep किया था कि engineering में

133
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,160
KT लगना बहुत आम बात है so don't get like

134
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,080
लड़का fail हो गया जो आज तक fail नहीं हुआ था

135
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,500
मैंने बहुत prep किया था

136
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,220
so when I got two KTs they were like

137
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,040
चल ठीक है यार तुने समझाया था कि

138
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,760
KT लगती है and you get a

139
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,060
another chance to kind of crack that exam

140
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,980
so they were all cool and I was cool

141
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,880
it was a very happy life going on till

142
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,860
my chacha ji

143
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,200
who used to work for L&T at that time in Delhi

144
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,220
he came in for a visit and he's like

145
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,400
engineering कैसे चल रही है बेटे

146
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,100
मैंने कहा ठीक चल रही है दो KT लगी है

147
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,380
mom dad ने बोला हाँ पर वो तो लगती रहती है

148
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,040
तो उन्होंने कहा ऐसे कैसे लगती रहती है

149
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,260
ऐसे लगनी नहीं चाहिए यह वो

150
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,320
then they also got very charged कि

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,760
ऐसे कैसे लग गई नहीं लगनी चाहिए

152
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,180
लगा रहे यार चाचा जी आपने काम खराब कर दिया

153
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,040
but then उसके बाद कभी नहीं लगी

154
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:41,500
मुझे याद है first year में हमें बोला जाता था

155
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,140
कि अगर KT लग गई मतलब career खतम

156
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,000
और बहुत डर लगता था KT से

157
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,040
आपकी you said mechanics में लगी ना

158
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,000
मतलब first semester

159
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,580
मेरी भी first semester में ही लग गई

160
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,840
और first semester में आपको कहा जाता है

161
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,880
मैं हर कोई नहीं कहता

162
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,840
life की सबसे बड़ी character development moment थी

163
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,420
honestly

164
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,340
मुझे actually no

165
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:13,320
मुझे exactly पता था कि ये दो paper में खराब गए

166
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,040
और ये दो paper में KT लग नहीं है

167
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,220
वो तो मैं surprise था कि

168
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:18,560
मेक पे मुझे reval में pass हो गया

169
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,440
मैं line में खड़ा था reval के लिए

170
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,280
for a friend of mine

171
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,080
कि यार मैं तेरे लिए line में खड़ा हूँ

172
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,320
there was a Kalina University में बहुत लंबी line लगी हुई थी

173
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,000
reval के लिए

174
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,640
उसने कहा तु line में खड़ा ही है

175
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,360
अपने भी paper डाली दे ना

176
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,760
तुझे पता है तु fail है पर डाल दे हो जाएगा

177
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,640
then in the next sem

178
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,680
by the time I was actually prepped and ready

179
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,820
to give the exam on mech

180
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,360
last moment I got a news that reval में

181
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,320
मैं mech में pass हो गया हूँ

182
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,160
so I was like चलो यार ठीक है वो भी अच्छा है

183
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,020
मैं थोड़ा ये system समझा देता हूँ

184
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,280
because you and me are talking with

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,660
understanding of trauma

186
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,880
system ये है कि

187
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,780
आपके 6 paper होते हैं first sem में

188
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,280
उसमें से कुछ-कुछ लोग fail हो जाते हैं

189
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,960
और अगर आपको किसी subject में

190
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,940
KT लगती है तो फिर second sem में

191
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,520
second sem के सारे subjects के साथ

192
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,460
5-6 subjects होते हैं उसके साथ आपको

193
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,260
एक या दो extra papers देने पड़ते हैं

194
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,900
उन exams के बीच और वो challenge होता है

195
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,940
and you get 5 chances

196
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,660
totally, total 5 chances and the 5th chance

197
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,820
is called the golden KT

198
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,860
कि अगर इसके बाद अगर आपको फिर भी KT लगी

199
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,900
then you get a year drop

200
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,700
इससे लोग डरते थे बहुत जादा यार

201
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:48,680
year drop तो बहुत बड़ी बात है

202
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,980
like suppressed artists

203
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,740
वो जब भी cultural fest आता है

204
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,300
you see like

205
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,600
कोई dance में तोड़ रहा है

206
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,900
कोई skits and plays and painting

207
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,160
and like anything

208
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,740
like it's just the cultural festivals of engineering colleges

209
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,940
are really top notch

210
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm getting goosebumps

211
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,800
क्योंकि आप सच बोल रहे हो

212
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,880
सच में होता है यार

213
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,700
it's a very interesting

214
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
environment I'll say that, character development

215
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,740
होती है क्योंकि maths

216
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,300
इतना जादा होता है हर subject में

217
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,460
तो आपका दिमाग भी थोड़ा mathematical हो जाता है

218
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,660
और I remember कि engineering के दोरान

219
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,340
I was having a very tough time क्योंकि

220
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,120
I don't know how your professors हो

221
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,560
but मेरे सारे professors नहीं कुछ बहुत अच्छे

222
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,800
professors भी थे जिन्होंने अच्छी character development दी थी

223
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,680
पर कुछ-कुछ professors बहुत pressure डालते हैं

224
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,140
I don't know if you went to

225
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,960
आप भी EXTC engineer हो which I find I'm weird

226
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,860
बहुत-बहुत कम EXTC engineers मिलते हैं

227
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,260
I know

228
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,380
I was very surprised to know यार क्योंकि

229
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,980
like you said बहुत कम मिलते हैं

230
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,360
मतलब mechanical से बहुत मिलते हैं

231
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,320
civil से बहुत मिलते हैं

232
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,400
comms और IT से तो बहुत मिलते हैं

233
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,660
but EXTC electronics and telecommunications

234
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,340
you find it like एक बहुत rare breed है ये

235
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:56,640
जो millennials के टाइम में cool field होते थी

236
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,520
I don't know कर अब cool field है कि नहीं

237
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,400
yeah even I don't know

238
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,960
but anyway EXTC is

239
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,480
some of the subjects are very difficult

240
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,820
EDC या था आपको BJT's, FET's

241
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,080
but मुझे actually I didn't mind EXTC

242
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,700
at all because मुझे वो circuits वगेरा

243
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,640
everything I was like

244
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,360
it didn't like मैं डरता नहीं था उनसे

245
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
जब अगर पढ़ने बैठूं

246
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,620
शिद्धत से तो मुझे समझ में आती थी बातें

247
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,880
so I was not very scared

248
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,120
यह मैं आम जनता को समझाओंगा

249
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,960
जो यह कहना कि यह समझ थे अच्छे से

250
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,500
यह मुझे आज तक समझ नहीं आया

251
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,200
circuits कैसे चलते हैं

252
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,800
जो current electricity का subject होता है न

253
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,760
उसका एक बहुत high level subject है यह

254
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,840
जिसमें मुझे KT में ली थी

255
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,880
PWE न

256
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,040
PWE I had gotten 89 out of 100

257
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,800
PWE I had scored

258
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,300
फिर से आम जनता के लिए

259
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,400
इनका physics oriented दिमाग बहुत अलग है

260
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,680
अगर उन्हें PWE समझ आए

261
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,140
मतलब यह बहुत कुछ visualize कर पाता है

262
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,780
I don't know कैसे हुआ है

263
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,100
that's what PWE is

264
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:50,360
it's remembering a lot of formula and visualizing

265
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,840
that's why you are a good actor

266
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,020
I don't know, maybe

267
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,740
वाओ, I'm loving talking about PWE too

268
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,660
I didn't think I'm gonna come here

269
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,180
and talk about PWE so much

270
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,680
I'm also actually enjoying it

271
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,000
बहुत सालों बाद BWE, CP, mechanics यह सब बात कर रहा हूँ

272
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,560
same

273
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,480
मुझे आद है जब YouTube की शुरुआत हुई थी भाई

274
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,780
and please chip in to give your film world experience also

275
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,240
YouTube की शुरुआत है camera के साथ होती है

276
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,700
basically आपको camera के सामने बैटना पड़ता है

277
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,080
and then also video record करने के बाद आपको edit करना है

278
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
आपको upload करना है

279
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,120
upload के लिए आपको YouTube के बारे में सीखना होता है

280
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,100
मैं बहुत जट से सीख गया

281
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,000
सब कुछ

282
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I had a friend explain stuff to me

283
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,980
but जट से सीख गया

284
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,940
and तब मुझे पता चला कि यार ये शायद

285
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,580
engineering college की वज़ा से हो रहा है

286
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,980
क्योंकि इतना ज़्यादा pressure होता है

287
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,200
to learn things fast

288
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
and that same thing I've applied in business

289
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,800
I've applied at age 30

290
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,880
जो podcasting भी बहुत जट से सीख

291
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
I don't know अगर आपको भी

292
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,520
फिल्मी दुनिया में ये ही feel होता है

293
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,660
and ये actually मुझे आपसे पूछना था

294
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,560
बहुत देर से

295
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,000
this is why I wanted to talk to you

296
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,060
since a very long time

297
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,320
you're one of the legends of engineering college

298
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,200
in Mumbai

299
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,720
तो engineering apply हो रही है अभी

300
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,920
life में

301
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,840
यार actually पता है

302
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,700
I'm sure हो रही है

303
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,680
पर जो पहलू हो रही है

304
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,260
I'll say in a very like a

305
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,280
not exactly like a philosophical way

306
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,460
but I would say की

307
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,580
जैसे ना I'll give you my dad's example

308
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:19,260
he वो पंजाब university में पढ़े है

309
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,860
and he wanted to become an English professor

310
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,540
MA in English literature

311
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,480
BA in English literature बगरा बगरा की है

312
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,320
and he became an action director

313
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,220
in films in Mumbai

314
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,600
long journey ब्ला ब्ला ब्ला

315
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,680
but I always used to ask him की यार वो

316
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,820
कहां गई वो कुछ help किया था या नहीं

317
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,580
and in college only I had decided

318
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,940
in my second year, third year actually

319
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,140
की मैं मुझे acting करनी

320
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,920
acting lifelong, I'm not gonna pursue

321
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,480
post grad because at that time

322
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,640
all my friends were like

323
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,320
यार इसके बाद MS करने

324
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,100
GRE का exam की prep चल रही थी

325
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,720
which is the requirement if you want to give that exam

326
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,980
and do post grad outside India

327
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,860
और जब आपके सारे friends वो कर रहे होते हैं ना

328
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,840
it takes a lot mentally to not do it

329
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,760
a lot, a lot, really a lot

330
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,340
because तो तब I used to ask him

331
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:03,800
की यार

332
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,880
आगे जाके ये तो नहीं लगा की कुछ गडबड हो गई

333
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,420
कुछ गलत decision हो गया, क्या हो गया

334
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,060
so he used to tell me की यार

335
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:13,420
जो भी करेगा तो graduation के बाद ही करेगा

336
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,500
graduation but you have to do it

337
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,780
पूरी मेहनत से because

338
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,180
ये formula शायद काम ना है

339
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,180
but जिस मेहनत से तू कर रहा है ना

340
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,360
वो मेहनत काम आएगी, वो आदत जो तब लगती है ना उस उमर में

341
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,300
की यार you have to give in your best

342
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,660
जो भी है रगडाने की जो आदत लगती ना

343
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:31,140
वो रगडाना जो है ना वो काम आता है

344
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,240
क्योंकि वहाँ अगर अपने complacency दिखा दी

345
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,100
कि ये करना तो है नी

346
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,120
and it's very subjective, मैं ये नहीं कह रहा हूँ ये universal

347
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,260
rule है, but मुझे

348
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,840
वो genuinely काम आया

349
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,160
कि वहाँ पे those four years even when I

350
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,660
knew that this is not what I'm gonna pursue

351
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,120
but at that time building relationships

352
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,100
camaraderie with your friends

353
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,260
giving everything to those subjects

354
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,120
and those exams and whatever that was, cultural

355
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,300
festivals, everything that those four years

356
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,040
had to offer to me, I gave

357
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,300
it my all and that

358
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,740
habit of giving it my all

359
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,020
is still relevant

360
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,000
when I have to, like because everything

361
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,180
I do is a project I take up, a role is a project

362
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,240
I take up and okay this is my project

363
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,680
जहांपे मुझे KT नहीं लग सकती

364
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,320
you know because I won't get another chance इसमें

365
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,240
so every film, every role is a golden

366
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,140
KT, so that

367
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,200
so वो शायद अभी help हो रही है

368
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,900
प्रो जो आपने कहा ना कि

369
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,880
KT नहीं लगनी चाहिए, मुझे याद है जब पहली बार

370
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,920
KT दिखी थी screen पे, आप हम

371
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,500
computer पे check करते थे हमारे results

372
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,860
first year में, जब KT

373
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:30,100
दिखती थी screen पे, बहुत

374
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,960
pain होता था, यार हमारे time पे तो

375
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,720
लगता था, वो sheet लगते थे, वो

376
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,880
second, third year में हुआ, अच्छा, I don't know

377
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,480
okay maybe there was a difference, yeah

378
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,940
but डर लगता था जब आप sheet check कर रहे थे न

379
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,880
on the wall, बहुत डर लगता था

380
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,920
डर लगता था, KT लगी है की नहीं

381
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,980
and

382
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,060
मुझे याद है, I used to motivate myself

383
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,800
for studying for the exam

384
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,740
with the fear I felt

385
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,020
while checking the previous SEMS results

386
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:55,880
मतलब I don't want to put myself in a

387
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,000
position to have that level of fear in my heart

388
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,720
इसलिए I'll do that extra महनत right now

389
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,860
and जो आप कह रहे हो नो

390
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,800
कि KT नहीं लगनी चाहिए, ये

391
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,740
जो एक, honestly, I feel कि

392
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,280
डर मेरा motivation रहा है

393
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,720
life में भी, कि I don't ever

394
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
want to not be able to bet on my

395
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,620
abilities. No, I feel

396
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,780
always that वो जो little fear element

397
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,720
होता है, डर होता है, that always brings the best

398
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,760
out of you, if you treat it as a motivational

399
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,640
factor, if you're gonna be

400
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,460
really like indulging in that

401
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,700
in a way that कि यार तुम्हें लग रहा है

402
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,600
कि यार it breaks your confidence

403
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,760
it has to be a stepping stone

404
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,620
अगर वो stepping stone आप बना दो तो that's actually a very

405
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,740
good advantage you have, you know that insecurity

406
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,200
that that डर provides you

407
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,220
that I feel is a great stepping

408
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,400
stone for you to achieve something which you feel

409
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,220
you might not be able to

410
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,260
अब, ब्रो, you're very

411
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,360
easy to talk to

412
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,440
engineering, ब्रो

413
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,060
ये क्यों होता है, because we understand

414
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,020
each other's *** हो दिया little bit, I don't know, maybe

415
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,760
maybe it's that, और वो

416
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,160
clarity होती है thinking में, but

417
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,240
I also want to genuinely tell you

418
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,200
क्योंकि ये show अभी शायद

419
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,180
चार साल पुरा आना है, और एक show की

420
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,820
बहुत बड़ी थीम military रही है

421
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,180
I know, I've seen some snippets of

422
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,220
this show where you've invited

423
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,260
like some really like experienced

424
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,580
people from the armed forces, yeah

425
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,960
and I think generally

426
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,200
the military collectively, I'll be very

427
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,160
honest with you, I'm gonna be very transparent

428
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,560
just let me

429
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,340
finish the full thing that I'm

430
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,080
saying, तो बहुत सारे

431
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,740
military generals

432
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,220
they used to get pissed off with military

433
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,040
based films, क्योंकि they used to feel

434
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,200
कि it's not accurate

435
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,840
पर हर कोई

436
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,120
Sam Manikshaw की फिल्म को लेकर बहुत

437
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,060
ज़्यादा excited है, क्योंकि वो literally

438
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,020
Indian military के सबसे बड़े

439
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,000
legend है, and जब मैंने पहली बार

440
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,880
सुना कि आप

441
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,060
उनका role निभार हो, plus एक photo आई थी

442
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,660
बहुत, I think एक दो साल पहले

443
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,900
जहाँ you know, it's a very famous

444
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
I was very happy, like I literally

445
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,100
clapped when I saw that, कि ये फिल्म बन रही है

446
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,520
and I know that that's how

447
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,920
at least the military audiences are looking at

448
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,720
the film, so just know that

449
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
it's already a great thing

450
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,200
बस ये बोलना चाहता हूँ

451
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,680
while I know that the military is थोड़ा

452
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,880
hesitant about it, but

453
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,940
generally everyone is very excited

454
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,520
no but it's

455
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,360
not news for me because

456
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,820
जितना मुझे army से interact करने का

457
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,580
मौका मिला है, when I was doing

458
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,960
Uri or now when I'm doing Sam Bahadur

459
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,040
and that film is coming out

460
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,760
I actually had

461
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,860
a lot of like

462
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,420
heart to heart conversations with them

463
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:28,900
and

464
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,840
what they think of cinema and what they think of

465
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,560
Hindi films में depiction कैसे होती है

466
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,600
and everything and of course like they have

467
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,960
also said this कि यार कि कई बार ऐसा होता है

468
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,520
कई बार हम समझते भी है कि कुछ

469
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,480
liberties लेनी पड़ती हैं कई बार कुछ जादा

470
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,600
line cross हो जाती है कि यार यह से थोड़ना हो सकता है

471
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,360
so but like

472
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,400
एक जो surface level पे I've seen

473
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,660
like them being very

474
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,280
sensitive about the uniforms

475
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,560
the medals, the badges and everything

476
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,400
तो वो क्योंके and I realized

477
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,340
because जब जितनी मेरी

478
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,220
training हुई उनके साथ जितना मैंने वक्त

479
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,120
बिताया उनके साथ कि यार

480
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,320
इन्होंने

481
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,300
literally डंडे खाये हैं

482
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,200
क्योंके सुबह उनकी जब drill होती थी

483
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,360
उनके uniform proper

484
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,400
नहीं होते थे तो उन्होंने

485
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,360
literally वो क्या कहते हैं

486
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,420
उससे there's a technical army

487
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,160
term for that where it's called like

488
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,460
it's a punishment that they get

489
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,540
and it's a hardcore punishment that they get

490
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,840
during their training days

491
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,540
if slightly by even

492
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,700
a margin कि आपकी इस्तरी खराब है ये खराब है

493
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,100
वो खराब है तो they get a punishment

494
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,080
तो जब हम वो ऐसी

495
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,520
पहन लेते हैं और medals are fully off and everything

496
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
they are bound to feel hurt about that

497
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,920
you know कि यार इतना तो ध्यान रख लो

498
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,280
so हमने अपनी तरफ से पूरी कोशिश किये

499
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,060
Sam Bahadur में and specially Meghna Gulzar

500
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,500
I have to give it to her that she

501
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,360
has been like a hawk on set

502
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,380
when it came to the color of the uniforms

503
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,780
the details of it because

504
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,980
इस लाइक यार उसके बिना हम tribute नहीं दे सकते

505
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,240
आर्मी को अगर हम uniform crack नहीं कर सकते

506
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,180
कुछ ऐसे भी military professionals

507
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,100
आया है शोपर जिनोंने military films

508
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,940
को appreciate भी किया है I don't know

509
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,740
if I'm saying too much here but

510
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,920
I feel कि आप देश के लिए भी कुछ कर रहो

511
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,680
through this film

512
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,260
नो of course यार like ये ना

513
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,160
not in a preachy way but I genuinely feel

514
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,360
कि जब मुझे ऐसे मौकें मिलते हैं

515
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,720
where I get to be part of films

516
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,760
where it's about

517
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,940
the heroes that have existed

518
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,540
in our motherland

519
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,980
जो not necessarily हमें पता हो

520
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,720
through education, through books or whatever

521
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,820
or maybe they are just like

522
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,660
not a detailed study in our history books

523
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,940
but they were just a mere mention

524
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,640
but if we get to study them it's just nice

525
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,580
to know that you know people

526
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:29,720
like me are just like

527
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,800
like Sam Manikshaw

528
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,660
or Sardar Udham

529
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,940
they've really existed, they were here

530
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,460
and they did something for the country

531
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,040
for which जिनके benefits आज तक हम ले रहे हैं

532
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,780
तो अगर मुझे अपने काम के जरिये

533
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,840
वो भी

534
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,540
जीने का मौका मिले और वो कहानी

535
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,240
आगे आज की यूद को दिखाने का मौका मिले

536
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,820
और experience कराने का मौका मिले

537
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,500
and if they resonate to it

538
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
it's just, I just feel

539
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,660
somewhere in the corner of my heart I feel good about

540
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,360
कि यार through my work

541
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,320
I could do something which had a certain

542
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,680
deeper meaning to it

543
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,080
I loved Sardar Udham

544
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,280
बहुत dark film थी

545
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,860
बहुत I think honest film थी

546
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,060
like from Sujit दा

547
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,840
like the more I interacted with him

548
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,020
I got to know like how, he literally is

549
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,460
like a Bhagat Singh fanboy

550
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,080
and it's a

551
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,960
story that he's lived with

552
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,380
for many many years

553
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,980
and I just was so like fortunate कि यार

554
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,480
मुझे उसका हिस्सा बनने का मौका मिले

555
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,740
and through his eyes and his vision

556
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,960
the way he saw the story

557
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,760
I thought there was a lot of purity in which he

558
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
he said that story

559
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,800
because he kept telling me यार कि

560
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,600
मुझे ये नहीं दिखाना है कि उन्होंने क्या क्या किया था

561
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,740
my

562
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,900
reason for which I want to make this

563
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,680
and why I get inspired by

564
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Bhagat Singh Ji and Udham Singh Ji

565
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,680
is because their state of mind

566
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,740
is what inspires me, so that is what we kept trying

567
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,020
to kind of get

568
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,780
Sardar Udham में कुछ scenes थे

569
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,260
जहां आप बहुत

570
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,560
dejected acting कर रहे थे

571
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,920
I remember you are just sitting like that in one scene

572
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,460
that's the scene that stayed with me

573
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,520
I don't know if you remember what I am talking about

574
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,260
पर दिया पोशन हो?

575
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,160
नहीं, early portion जहां वो

576
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,980
यहां तो I think जेल से just निकले है

577
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,660
it was one of the early portions

578
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,840
and my thought was कि

579
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,020
क्या Vicky Kaushal ने भी इतनी साथा

580
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,380
dejection देखी है life में to be able to act

581
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,860
with that kind of pain

582
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,760
and plus आपके फिल्मों में ना

583
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,360
बहुत साइए लोगों आपके साथ बहुत

584
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,940
अलग reasons के लिए connect करते हैं

585
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,820
but a lot of guys connect with you

586
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:26,460
because आप बहुत silent male pain को

587
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,280
अच्छे से depict करते हो, I don't know if you got

588
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,900
what I am saying, I got what you are saying

589
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,960
but I have never seen like, obviously I can't

590
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,560
objectively see my performances like that

591
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,220
maybe I am giving you engineering bro

592
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,780
perspective, don't mind the

593
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,560
sounding good to me

594
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,820
पर एक

595
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,500
silent masculine pain दिखाई देता

596
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,540
आपके performances में

597
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,580
जिससे bros connect कर पाते हैं

598
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,780
I think that's why you have both of female and male

599
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,700
fan following, honestly

600
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,700
but I think in

601
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,980
Sardar Udham, if I just pick that example out

602
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,840
all that I was

603
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,100
thinking where

604
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,060
in the later stages when I am like late 30s

605
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,240
40s and when I am like

606
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,340
in London and roaming around

607
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,860
the one demarcation like when I

608
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,840
have to, I feel कि I am overthinking

609
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,440
a character or I am making like too

610
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,920
many ideas and theories in my head

611
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,440
I like to simplify

612
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,240
things and then I just put like one word

613
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,340
like I just put like one block idea

614
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,460
so I just, I remember during Sardar Udham

615
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,840
because it was such a silent

616
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,160
kind of a portrayal with not

617
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,260
many dialogues, the first 20 minutes of the film

618
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,420
you don't even hear him talk

619
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,820
so I just said कि यार जब तक

620
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,060
he is not done what he is

621
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,240
wanting to do

622
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,240
imagine like there is a weight of 2000 kilos

623
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,360
on your shoulder, you are carrying a lot

624
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,060
of weight and I said कि let me just

625
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,280
start with just literally feeling a physical

626
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
weight, I know it's more like a mental

627
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,700
weight but let me just do everything

628
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,420
where I feel like a physical weight on me

629
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,260
and when I play the 19 year old

630
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,800
just get that weight off

631
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,960
that's how I kind of just in my

632
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,900
head just simplified in terms of

633
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,700
कि अच्छा है ये दो लोगों में ब्रॉड

634
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,880
क्या फ़रक है

635
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,820
and that's maybe that's where

636
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,800
it started from in a physical form and then

637
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,260
obviously in the mental form

638
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,880
men in

639
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,740
general are conditioned to kind of suppress

640
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:15,260
feelings and like ठीक है यार होता है

641
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,160
होता है ठीक है बस चल रहा है भाई

642
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,240
तो वो एक पता नहीं वो शायद

643
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,240
वैसा भी है but I don't know

644
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,280
I can't dig deep in that

645
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,380
कि because

646
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,180
how it lands on a viewer is very

647
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,380
subjective. मैं ये सवाल

648
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,440
इसलिए पूछ रहा हूँ क्योंकि

649
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,100
YouTube को चलाने के लिए हमें

650
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,900
data को बहुत ज़्यादा study करना पड़ता है

651
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,180
कि who should we get next

652
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,960
on the show, what subject should we talk about next

653
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,060
I'm assuming it's something similar, I know

654
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,260
it's something similar in the film world

655
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,660
मतलब एक concept को

656
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,760
create करने से बढ़े

657
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,660
thoughts जाते हैं

658
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,780
मेरा सवाल ये

659
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,220
कि actually मेरा सवाल नहीं, मेरा input ये

660
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,960
कि at least I'm noticing

661
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,600
Gen Z's, Millennials भी

662
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,960
history को लेकर बहुत ज़्यादा excited है

663
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,920
आजकल, they feel कि

664
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,160
we should have been taught even more about

665
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,380
India's history

666
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,160
शायद

667
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,860
शायद इसलिए

668
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,760
I feel कि automatically maybe the film world

669
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,640
might go on a bit of a historical tangent

670
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,720
audience का demand है

671
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,740
that's why we've gone on a full historical tangent

672
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,560
usually what happens is, at least I don't know

673
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,560
what the textbooks are saying today, I don't know

674
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,980
how they are like, syllabus wise

675
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,740
but जो मुझे याद है, जो हमें

676
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,040
पढ़ाया गया था, जितना याद है

677
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,220
इसकी यार हमें से बताता है

678
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,380
like I said कि वो फरक होता है कि

679
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,660
क्या हुआ in terms of incidents

680
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,840
just to cover a wider

681
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,540
because history यार एक textbook में भी

682
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,640
खतम करना बहुत मुश्किल है

683
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,520
पर हम school में

684
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,760
it's more कि यार anecdotal

685
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,800
कि यार ये हुआ था, फिर इस साल में ये हुआ था

686
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,900
फिर इस साल में ये हुआ था

687
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,400
but like the thing that

688
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,200
hit me the most when we were shooting

689
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,300
सरदार उदम was कि यार

690
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,120
जल्लिया वाला बाग massacre हुआ था

691
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,540
जिसमें इतने लोग मरे

692
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:58,260
और वो हमें सवाल पूछा

693
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,440
exam में हमने लिख दिया

694
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,160
but we didn't really feel it

695
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,180
we don't know what it really feels to

696
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,280
lose that many lives on a single

697
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,180
plot of land in one night

698
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,820
so वो

699
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,400
उसका impact realize कराना

700
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,500
is true kind of

701
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,000
understanding of history

702
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,300
also the way that scene was shot

703
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:22,200
बहुत कुछ feel होता है आपको as an Indian

704
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,520
जो आप वो scene देख रहे हो

705
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,940
it's probably one of the most difficult scenes to watch

706
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,420
that I've ever watched in my life

707
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,760
it was one of the probably the most difficult scene to

708
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,540
perform as well

709
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,260
पूरे career में?

710
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,420
पूरे career में?

711
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,000
बताओ

712
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,420
it was

713
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,800
it was because

714
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,740
of course I was prepared for a few things

715
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,720
but there were certain things which I was not prepared for

716
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,420
on a deeper level

717
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:49,480
because जो हमने वो sequence पूरा

718
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,600
shoot किया वो तक्रीबन like

719
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,680
doing it for like 20 days

720
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,260
and

721
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,400
एक चीज जो मुझे पहले ही warn की थी

722
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,320
सुझीदा ने was कि यार dummy bodies नहीं होगे

723
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,800
it will be real bodies

724
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,900
and

725
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,200
मैं तुझे छोड़ दूँगा

726
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,780
like there was a three camera setup out of which one camera

727
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,860
I never knew where it was

728
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,500
out of the two cameras like they would

729
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,080
light the whole ground

730
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,500
and then there was no like

731
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,440
कि अच्छा यार next shot we have this much time

732
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,420
so you rest it out or whatever

733
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,820
once we are on the ground we are on the ground

734
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,660
and then it's just like changing angles and whatever

735
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,400
मैं थोड़ा सा context देना चाहूँगा

736
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,640
जिन लोगों ने वो scene नहीं देखी

737
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,780
जल्यनवाला बाग incident को depict किया गया

738
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,200
quite graphically

739
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,480
in that film

740
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,040
and I think it's actually the highlight of that film

741
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,500
the way that they've done justice to that incident

742
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,560
and the second aspect is

743
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,720
what you're talking about right now

744
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,260
जहां सर्दार उद्धम का character वहाँ पहुँचता है

745
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,720
incident के बाद और

746
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,000
बॉडीज को उठाता है

747
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,860
जल्यनवाला बाग से बच्चों की बॉडीज को उठाता है

748
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:50,300
and that whole stretch is very very intense to watch as a view

749
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,380
please continue भाई

750
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:54,720
so when we started shooting

751
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,420
obviously ये बताये गया था कि

752
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,360
जैसे मैंने कहा कि

753
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,740
there won't be any dummy bodies

754
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,540
there will be real bodies

755
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,280
and I don't want you to rehearse

756
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,540
how to pick them up

757
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,740
I want to see a 19 year old

758
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,600
not knowing how to pick them up

759
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,180
so struggling how to pick them up

760
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,440
and then getting tired and whatever

761
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,580
so we kept shooting like I said for like 20 nights

762
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,640
where there was the ground

763
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,280
then taken to the hospital

764
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,200
the streets

765
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,000
the houses

766
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,200
everything put together

767
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,960
the night was divided into 6 stages

768
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,940
because there was a lot of blood coming on me

769
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,700
and everything

770
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,220
so in terms of like technicality wise

771
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,000
continuity had to be maintained and all of that

772
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,400
but let's just say A, B, C, D, E, F whatever

773
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,160
so वो stages में like we kept shooting

774
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,680
we kept shooting

775
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,240
and in fact all the people

776
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,620
who were lying down there

777
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,000
they were also told

778
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,680
की

779
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:46,640
I can come and pick up anybody

780
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,100
so you have to lie down

781
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,240
and only brief that was given to me was

782
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,980
you genuinely search for people

783
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,000
की कोई जिन्दा है

784
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,600
अगर कोई हिलता हुआ दिखा

785
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,460
consider them injured

786
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,540
and you would try to save them

787
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,140
that was the brief given to me

788
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,280
and the camera will follow you

789
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,300
don't worry about anything

790
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,920
and it became like a stage for me

791
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,960
and what I was not prepared for

792
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,120
after doing it like

793
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,220
you know

794
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,860
many times was that

795
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,660
somewhere in the middle

796
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,040
it just hit me that there was a boy

797
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,280
actually doing that one night

798
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,560
and that hit me very strongly

799
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,500
like I could not sleep after going back home

800
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,400
and I would sit with Sujit da also

801
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,180
and I would be like

802
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,200
कि सर में को नीन नहीं आ रही

803
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,440
and he is like I understand

804
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,880
but you know

805
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,980
but we kept doing that

806
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,780
we kept doing that

807
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,220
because we felt कि यार

808
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,980
कुछ तो सही हो रहा है

809
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,260
अगर हमें ये feel हो रहा है

810
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,740
and everybody like that night

811
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,120
like

812
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,520
over there we shot in Amritsar

813
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,840
and the people were very cooperative

814
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,300
पूरी पूरी राज ठड में वो लेते रहते थे

815
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,920
because they knew what we were trying to create

816
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,400
recreate

817
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,020
तो they were very supportive

818
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,700
and it took a lot

819
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,780
like a lot of team effort

820
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,660
but just as an actor

821
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,320
it was like

822
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,620
it just grounded me a lot

823
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,880
like I thought that

824
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,700
that happened with me

825
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,680
when I was shooting Masaan

826
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,880
and prepping for Masaan

827
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,580
when I would spend time

828
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,520
at the Ghat

829
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,300
Masaan Ghat

830
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,200
and you know

831
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,060
see dead bodies getting burnt

832
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,740
but this was

833
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,760
a little

834
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:11,980
I don't know

835
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,040
strangely deeper than that

836
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,480
and

837
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,260
deeper than that

838
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,520
yeah

839
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,680
because

840
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,660
this was

841
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,180
there was agony

842
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:18,820
there was pain

843
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,560
there was trauma

844
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,240
there was

845
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,920
and I had to do that

846
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,940
all feeling like a child

847
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,180
like you know

848
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,420
because in the film also

849
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,120
you see him like

850
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:27,840
before that incident

851
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,440
not really

852
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,920
really being very like

853
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,700
revoltish about freedom

854
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,180
or whatever

855
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:32,860
he was just a kid

856
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,520
living his life

857
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,600
and you know

858
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,500
but

859
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,440
that night

860
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,440
changed

861
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,820
Sardar Udham Singh Ji

862
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,200
and that night

863
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:41,960
kind of the depiction

864
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,680
of that night

865
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,420
kind of just

866
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,920
like made me realize

867
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,100
that

868
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,680
if we say

869
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,340
that we had gone

870
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,620
for our freedom struggle

871
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,120
then its impact

872
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,440
I felt

873
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,080
for the first time

874
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,540
in that

875
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,560
deeper sense

876
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,760
that what does it mean

877
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,860
I would like to say

878
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:01,540
a very straightforward thing

879
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,620
I feel that

880
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,080
you are a very blessed man

881
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,960
to be able to play

882
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,600
such characters

883
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,060
I agree

884
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,160
I feel that so

885
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,500
I feel that really

886
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,020
have you ever thought

887
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:09,440
about this

888
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:09,800
because

889
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:09,960
you know

890
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
seeing your career

891
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:11,660
from the outside

892
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,120
Uri

893
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,820
Sardar Udham

894
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,780
and Sam Bahadur

895
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,960
just in three films

896
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,460
because of which

897
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,460
I feel that you are

898
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,360
in many ways

899
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,400
a chosen one

900
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,940
I am not

901
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,280
I am genuinely saying

902
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,800
what it feels like

903
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,420
from the outside

904
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,780
maybe that is why

905
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,460
people are rallying

906
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,180
behind you also

907
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,520
I don't know

908
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,500
but I do feel like

909
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,260
I do feel blessed

910
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,200
to get these opportunities

911
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:33,860
because they are

912
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,720
like we discussed

913
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:36,420
because we have discussed

914
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,180
engineering days

915
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,100
when we left engineering

916
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,240
I wanted to be an actor

917
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,800
I wanted to be an actor

918
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,900
2009 I am like

919
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,680
okay let me just do

920
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,620
an acting course

921
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,560
and that too was like

922
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,260
you know I had

923
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,080
I had said

924
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,780
that I want to be an actor

925
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,100
but I didn't have confidence

926
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,180
to be very honest

927
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,040
because that time

928
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,160
was also not the time

929
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,220
like we have today

930
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:52,940
where actors

931
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,700
even if you do a film

932
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,000
and if your work is good

933
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
you will be like

934
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,760
there will be curiosity

935
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,280
around you

936
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,400
that which new actor

937
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:00,600
has come

938
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,660
that time was not

939
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,200
that era

940
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,600
you know

941
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,740
it was a very hero era

942
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,660
launch era

943
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,340
whatever

944
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,800
so then

945
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,860
I didn't have confidence

946
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,160
but from that journey

947
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,800
when you start

948
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,780
then you struggle

949
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:11,960
and then you give auditions

950
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,720
and blah blah blah

951
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,700
theatre and everything

952
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,800
after that

953
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,480
when you see today

954
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,020
that yes man

955
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,300
you are getting such role

956
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,600
and such directors

957
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,240
are showing you confidence

958
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,520
and for these legendary roles

959
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,120
and characters

960
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,960
it really feels like

961
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,440
a blessing

962
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:24,780
because

963
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,000
whether it is Sardar Udham Singh

964
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,140
or Hissam Bahadur

965
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,700
I have heard their stories

966
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,020
at home

967
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,420
and we have discussed

968
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,320
and then

969
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,760
I don't realize

970
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,720
that today

971
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,600
I have got that chance

972
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,900
to understand their life

973
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,440
and then

974
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,000
then

975
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,100
to tell people

976
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,800
that story

977
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,840
as that guy

978
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,740
that

979
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,880
that hits in retrospect

980
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,100
sometimes

981
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,380
but when it hits

982
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,100
then it hits very strongly

983
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,100
and you feel like

984
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,320
there is a lot of gratitude

985
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,400
that you feel

986
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:50,600
that

987
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,000
whatever is happening

988
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,340
in the universe

989
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,600
God is really

990
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,740
taking care of you

991
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,000
universe

992
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:57,760
destiny

993
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,440
God

994
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,300
there are a lot of such things

995
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,460
on the show

996
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,780
and I have known

997
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,080
that

998
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,720
the mega successful people

999
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,260
are

1000
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,500
a very big role

1001
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:07,520
of destiny

1002
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,120
yeah

1003
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,140
do you

1004
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,400
agree

1005
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,400
of course there is hard work

1006
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,380
that is the basis

1007
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:11,980
that is constant

1008
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,220
I am a strong

1009
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,640
very strong believer

1010
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,800
in destiny and karma

1011
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,960
I am a super strong believer

1012
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,400
in that

1013
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:19,840
like

1014
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,300
and it is like

1015
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,200
immovable

1016
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,640
like at times

1017
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:25,980
when I

1018
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,840
especially at times

1019
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,600
when I don't get

1020
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,560
what I really want to

1021
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,300
I really have now learned

1022
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
to take it as a blessing

1023
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,020
because

1024
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,380
I literally have

1025
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,660
now when I look back

1026
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,280
and I feel

1027
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:36,480
that

1028
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,140
I didn't get that film

1029
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,000
that I wanted to do

1030
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,540
and that was about to happen

1031
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,340
but then now I see

1032
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:42,860
and I am like

1033
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,460
thank God

1034
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:44,880
it didn't happen

1035
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,640
you know

1036
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:45,940
because

1037
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,760
in return

1038
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,360
this was all

1039
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,180
so now I am really

1040
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,120
like I know that

1041
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:50,640
that

1042
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,940
if your hard work is there

1043
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,860
your intention is clear

1044
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,380
you are working with truth

1045
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,280
you will be good

1046
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,540
and

1047
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,980
sometimes you don't understand

1048
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,920
what is good for you

1049
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,360
at this time

1050
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,720
but I

1051
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,360
I just live with that faith

1052
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,340
that there is a stronger

1053
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,240
and

1054
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,040
and stronger force

1055
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,940
and I am going to

1056
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,380
take care of you

1057
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:11,780
okay

1058
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,140
I wanted to ask you this same question

1059
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,280
from a long time

1060
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:15,600
like

1061
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,860
you were one of the people

1062
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,560
I wanted on the show

1063
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,180
for very long

1064
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,000
maybe because of

1065
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,980
Engineering College Connect

1066
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,040
actually mostly because of that

1067
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,560
also because of your career

1068
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,520
but I knew

1069
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,820
how I will be able to talk to you

1070
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,140
I think at this point of the show

1071
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,760
you must have known

1072
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,920
what is my intention

1073
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,580
with this podcast

1074
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,740
I am trying to

1075
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,080
get to learn

1076
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,260
what's made you

1077
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,940
at this point

1078
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,440
now

1079
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,840
a round is coming

1080
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:38,880
now

1081
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:38,980
that is

1082
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,260
on the show

1083
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,140
where I will ask you

1084
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,360
a little deep question

1085
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,820
okay

1086
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,800
psychological question

1087
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,480
so please take your time with it

1088
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:45,960
this is the

1089
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,900
fear to win the round

1090
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,300
you don't have to

1091
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,100
answer it quickly

1092
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,320
okay

1093
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,380
but take your time

1094
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,000
I will also ask you

1095
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,360
a tangential question

1096
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:54,820
okay

1097
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,640
Vicky Kaushal

1098
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
your father

1099
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,560
has been the leading

1100
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,460
action director of films

1101
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,740
what has your father

1102
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,640
taught you

1103
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,160
about fear

1104
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,880
or courage

1105
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
directly

1106
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
or not

1107
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
I think

1108
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
he has instilled

1109
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,880
this faith in me

1110
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,880
of not having a safety net

1111
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,880
where what I would be seeing

1112
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,880
otherwise

1113
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,880
that when you leave engineering

1114
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,880
especially when you leave that field

1115
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,880
and I had a job letter

1116
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
I had given a campus interview

1117
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
I had a job

1118
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
ECS

1119
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,880
no it wasn't ECS

1120
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,880
it was

1121
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,880
at that time it was called

1122
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,880
Patni computers

1123
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,880
but now I think it's

1124
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,880
Capgemini

1125
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,880
oh yeah

1126
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:29,880
they have taken it over

1127
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
but

1128
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,880
then he said that

1129
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
I have a job

1130
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,880
ECS

1131
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
no it wasn't ECS

1132
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,880
it was

1133
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,880
at that time it was called

1134
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,880
Patni computers

1135
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,760
but now I think it's Capgemini

1136
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
and I think

1137
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
if you are coming here

1138
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,760
tear it

1139
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,760
like know that

1140
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
you don't have a backup

1141
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
sometimes that helps

1142
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
but

1143
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
be the man

1144
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,760
that gives you the energy

1145
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,760
that there is nothing else

1146
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,760
there is nothing else

1147
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
and

1148
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,760
sometimes that gives you

1149
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,760
that little edge

1150
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,760
that little one extra percent edge

1151
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
which needs

1152
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,760
where

1153
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,760
where it's just that

1154
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,760
supernatural force

1155
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
that comes into you

1156
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,760
that I have to do it

1157
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,760
I don't have anything else

1158
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
so I think

1159
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
what I have learnt is

1160
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
that courage

1161
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
is

1162
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
coming from

1163
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
not having a safety net

1164
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,760
but plan bhi hona hi nahi chahiye

1165
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,760
that helps

1166
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,760
helps me

1167
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,760
same

1168
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,760
personally

1169
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
like I said

1170
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,760
it's all subjective

1171
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,760
it's all very very subjective

1172
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
depending on

1173
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,760
your conditions

1174
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,760
and where you are

1175
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
what you are doing

1176
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,760
your state of mind

1177
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
and everything

1178
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
but that

1179
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,760
not having a safety net

1180
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,760
always always makes me do

1181
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,760
something that

1182
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760
I feel I don't have it in me

1183
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,760
whereas

1184
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,760
when I have that safety net

1185
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,760
I feel

1186
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
I wouldn't push myself

1187
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
to that

1188
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
that extent

1189
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
umm

1190
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,760
because of your humility

1191
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,760
you are saying

1192
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
that it applies to you

1193
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
and I understand what you are saying

1194
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,760
because you have also seen life

1195
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,760
you have talked to different people

1196
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
but I would definitely say

1197
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,760
at age 22

1198
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
plan bhi nahi hona chahiye

1199
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
because

1200
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
that is the only phase of your life

1201
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
where you can take so much risk

1202
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
without thinking about fear

1203
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
and

1204
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
I feel it's important to not have a plan bhi

1205
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,760
at 22

1206
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,760
I agree

1207
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
I have often said this on the show

1208
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,760
a balls to the wall mentality happens

1209
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
that

1210
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
do or die

1211
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
yeah yeah

1212
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
okay

1213
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Vicky Kaushal

1214
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
in your entire career

1215
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
for which role did you have to

1216
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,760
put the most effort?

1217
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:20,760
yeah obviously

1218
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
it's

1219
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
the context here is

1220
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
Masaan

1221
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,760
was at age 24 or 25

1222
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,760
so

1223
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,760
I am also asking the boy Vicky Kaushal

1224
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,760
yeah

1225
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,760
did you put more effort then

1226
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,760
or

1227
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
for Sam Bahadur

1228
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,760
Sam Bahadur

1229
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,760
really

1230
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,760
it's only because of

1231
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
umm

1232
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
the man he was

1233
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
it's not a fictional character

1234
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,760
so

1235
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
there is a glory you have to live up to

1236
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
you can't

1237
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
you just didn't have

1238
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,760
even one degree of scope to just fool around

1239
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,760
or miss the mark

1240
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
because

1241
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
whenever I would interact with the Indian army

1242
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
they would be very encouraging

1243
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
they would give a lot of love

1244
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
a lot of faith

1245
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,760
but they would always end it

1246
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
with saying

1247
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
you better do a good job

1248
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,760
he is our best man

1249
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
so that would always like

1250
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,760
kind of like you know

1251
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,760
scare me a little bit

1252
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
so I think

1253
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
the one I was most scared of

1254
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,760
was Sam Bahadur

1255
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
the kind of prep that got involved

1256
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
and everyday on set

1257
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
the constant reminder that

1258
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,760
just remember whom you are playing

1259
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
just remember the man whom you are playing

1260
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
and

1261
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
yeah

1262
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
so I would

1263
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
to answer this question

1264
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,760
it is definitely Sam Bahadur

1265
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
okay

1266
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
yeah

1267
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
there is a tangential question

1268
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
which I wanted to ask earlier

1269
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
yeah

1270
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,760
when you

1271
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,760
play these character with this stature

1272
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
do you feel on some level

1273
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,760
their legacy

1274
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,760
or

1275
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,760
their soul is present on set

1276
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
I felt that during Sam Bahadur

1277
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
and

1278
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,760
and I am so

1279
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:41,760
like

1280
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
it is so strange

1281
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
you asked me this question

1282
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
because

1283
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,760
me and Meghna have said this

1284
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
to just each other

1285
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
not even like announcing it to a team

1286
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,760
we would just sit on the side and

1287
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
sometimes Meghna would say that

1288
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
you know I feel him

1289
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,760
and sometimes I would say that

1290
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
Meghna I feel him

1291
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
we really

1292
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
because this film

1293
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
during the shoot

1294
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
or

1295
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
just the

1296
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
the

1297
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
the

1298
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
the

1299
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
the

1300
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,760
the

1301
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
the

1302
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
just the

1303
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
existence of this film

1304
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,760
till

1305
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,760
like now

1306
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
when

1307
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
it is releasing and everything

1308
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
so many things that

1309
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:11,760
that have gone against

1310
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
the film

1311
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,760
like just making of the film

1312
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
so many things

1313
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
sometimes location

1314
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
sometimes logistic

1315
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,760
sometimes this

1316
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,760
sometimes that

1317
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
everything that we ended up doing

1318
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
in the way

1319
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,760
we ended up doing

1320
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,760
was just the best thing

1321
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,760
that could have happened to the film

1322
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,760
and

1323
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
every time

1324
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
something like this would happen

1325
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,760
we would feel that

1326
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
this

1327
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,760
we were not aiming for this

1328
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,760
we were

1329
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,760
we actually had a different plan

1330
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,180
बट we ended up doing

1331
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,040
what was literally the best thing

1332
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,400
for the film

1333
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,900
and from the smallest to the biggest things

1334
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,500
but every time we would be like

1335
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,000
Sam is here

1336
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,200
so we would feel that many times

1337
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,980
and I genuinely genuinely feel that

1338
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,340
like

1339
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,840
very deeply

1340
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,860
like he's watching it

1341
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,600
लाइफ के इस मोड पर

1342
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,240
अब आपको किस बात का

1343
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,900
डर लगता है

1344
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,360
अब इस बात का डर लगता है

1345
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,400
कि कहीं मैं कोई भी

1346
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,720
चीज regarding my work or anything

1347
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,340
or relationship or anything

1348
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:10,120
किसी चीज को granted ना लो

1349
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,400
because now you have the opportunity to take things

1350
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,620
granted पहले नहीं थी

1351
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,320
पहले वो था ही नहीं आपके पास

1352
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
कि आप उसे granted लो क्योंकि है ही नहीं आपके पास

1353
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,380
जब आपके पास वो आ जाती है

1354
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,020
चीजें like specially like पहले

1355
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,200
काम नहीं था तो काम चाहिए

1356
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,620
आप granted किसको लोग है

1357
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,120
काम मिलने लगा पर वो मिलने लगा

1358
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,200
auditions दे दे के

1359
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,940
फिर ऐसा नहीं था कि आपके पास 10 script आ रही है और आप

1360
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,840
choose कर रहे हो अब

1361
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,160
by God's grace you are in that position

1362
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
कि आपके पास script आ रही है you can choose

1363
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
what you want to do and what

1364
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
you don't want to do this is the

1365
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,780
time when you don't want to take things for granted

1366
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,400
you know and I think you start slipping

1367
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,180
and because you don't fall you start

1368
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,860
slipping when you take things for granted

1369
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
and before you realize it's like a little

1370
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,640
late so

1371
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,260
it's this is the phase where

1372
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,280
my biggest fear is that कि आर anything

1373
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,180
that is because you have a team working

1374
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,180
with you anything that

1375
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,140
you would want to kind of prep for a role or

1376
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,060
do something or it's there

1377
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,200
it's available everything is available right now

1378
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,980
so when things are available is when you start

1379
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,520
taking the basics for granted

1380
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,740
so अभी डर वो रहता है

1381
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,840
back of the mind when you're hitting the bed in the end of the day

1382
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,680
you just have to be prepared कि यार

1383
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,060
ग्राटेट मत लो

1384
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,140
you know

1385
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,600
keep that hunger alive

1386
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,980
रॉकी थ्री देखी है आपने

1387
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,040
या हंगर मर जाता है उसका

1388
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,100
correct exactly

1389
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,400
then he has to kind of

1390
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,100
start from scratch

1391
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:36,180
रॉकी के five parts है

1392
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,980
अभी बहुत सारे parts बन चुके

1393
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,740
but originally five parts

1394
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,880
for me three was the most important कि एक बार आप

1395
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,500
champion बन गए फिर championship

1396
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:43,720
बन चुके

1397
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,780
belt खोनी नहीं है

1398
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,840
it's like they say ना कि वो

1399
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:50,180
champion बनना

1400
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,940
is easier than champion रहना

1401
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,880
so it's that

1402
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,160
shift जब हो रहा होता है that transition

1403
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,600
is where you start

1404
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,820
taking things for granted

1405
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,700
it's when everyday at work or everyday

1406
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,920
wherever you are whatever you do is the first day

1407
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,920
at job is when you'll be like

1408
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,200
यहां ठीक है यार करना है

1409
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,880
अब basically फिर से

1410
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,840
humility की बाते कर रहो यहां

1411
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,500
and I feel कि

1412
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,180
humility सबसे बड़ा

1413
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,780
factor होता है at the stage you are at

1414
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,620
और यह भी मैंने show से सीखा है यह मैं खुद का

1415
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,640
opinion नहीं दे रहा हूँ my job is to observe

1416
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,600
you guys mostly हर को

1417
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,400
humility को लेकर थोड़ा सा डरता है

1418
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,240
कि like I don't want my humility to fade away

1419
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,460
and I also feel कि लोग आपसे इसलिए

1420
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,480
connect कर पाते हैं पर लोगों ने आज

1421
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,400
जाना है कि आप एक engineering college

1422
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,380
student हो आप Mac fail हो

1423
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,840
humility कभी जाएगी नहीं

1424
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,280
so Vicky Kaushal

1425
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,480
यही था डर से जीत तक का round but I got to

1426
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,260
know you more

1427
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,160
अभी मैं थोड़ा सा और

1428
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,700
ice break करना चाहूँगा

1429
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,180
जब मैं

1430
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,040
आपसे बाहर मिला

1431
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,940
मुझे पता रहता है कि मेरे guest

1432
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,260
कौन सी vibe ला रहे हैं

1433
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,940
आपसे एक बहुत intense energy

1434
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,100
feel होती है you are a very intense guy

1435
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,200
now you are not

1436
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,440
energy speaks before person speaks

1437
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,020
not just the beard

1438
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,880
पर आपके दिमाग में बहुत thoughts चल रहे थे

1439
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,920
इसी quantity of thoughts की

1440
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,520
वज़े से आपको success मिला

1441
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,100
क्या आपने engineer किया अपनी life को

1442
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:21,900
that's what I feel

1443
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,960
I can never actually

1444
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,120
decode why

1445
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,840
I have gotten success

1446
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,920
because sometimes I feel it's also

1447
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,460
sure it's your hard work

1448
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,140
it's what you have put into the job

1449
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,380
and you know

1450
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,060
you have to give in that much to get out of it

1451
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:42,600
ये वो पर मुझे बहुत लगता है कि बहुत किस्मत भी होता है

1452
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,020
बहुत लोगों की दुआएं भी होती है

1453
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,680
upbringing भी होती है

1454
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,540
मतलब I don't know

1455
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,600
it's just like I feel

1456
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,780
when you say my success

1457
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:56,220
it's got to

1458
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,640
of course it's got to do with me

1459
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,700
but it's got a lot to do with the people

1460
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,720
who put faith in me

1461
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,100
people who put

1462
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,420
kind of like

1463
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,840
I don't know मुझे ऐसे लगता है बहुत लोगों का भी एक effort होता है

1464
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,460
it's always a team thing that

1465
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,600
you know कभी भी वो मेरी success नहीं हो सकती

1466
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,300
मुझे कभी भी वो जो term होता है self-made man

1467
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,580
I don't think you are ever a self-made man

1468
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,760
you know आप अकेले कुछ नहीं

1469
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,380
उखाड सकते

1470
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,180
you know आपको कई लोगों का सहारा मिला

1471
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,740
कई लोगों ने मौके दिये

1472
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,100
उनके साथ काम किया

1473
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,300
जिसमें आपका काम निखर के आया

1474
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,000
especially when you are an actor

1475
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,640
मैं कितनी भी अच्छी acting कर लूँ

1476
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,580
you need a lot of good technicians

1477
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,880
around you, you need a

1478
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,940
solid script, you need a great director

1479
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,080
to वो काम

1480
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,360
निखर के लोगों तक पहुँचे, you need an audience

1481
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,340
you know वो audience आपको बनाती है

1482
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,640
तो मुझे लगता है वो success का

1483
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,320
of course because you are the subject

1484
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,140
of that success

1485
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,300
और उसमें आपने महनत की है

1486
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,900
वो उतना होता है बड़ उसके इलावा

1487
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:55,080
बहुत सारी चीज़ें और involved होती हैं

1488
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,840
जो you can't take like

1489
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,640
जिसकी ये मेरा है

1490
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,920
it's given to you and then it's taken from you also

1491
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,200
that ज्यादा KT में feel होता था

1492
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,500
या एक flop film के बाद

1493
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,320
more than KT

1494
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,160
क्यूं?

1495
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,300
flop film के बाद कई बार मौके कम मिलते हैं न

1496
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,720
KT में आपको बता है पाँच और है

1497
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,060
ये actually होता है?

1498
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,080
नहीं यार दर्द इसलिए भी होता है क्योंकि यार

1499
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,560
जब आप exam दे रहे हो

1500
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,920
वो आपकी महनत है सिर्फ आप

1501
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,580
और आपको KT लगी है

1502
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,320
जब आप film करते हो बहुत लोगों की महनत है

1503
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,860
और वो जब film नहीं चलती है

1504
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,120
वो सब को effect करता है

1505
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,960
in terms of the kind of next opportunity

1506
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,500
you'll get

1507
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,440
उसको build करना

1508
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,980
उस faith को with the audience

1509
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,620
वो credibility को build करना

1510
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,600
and of course I'm not saying कि मतलब

1511
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,860
वो it's all

1512
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,660
part and parcel आपकी चलेगी भी और

1513
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,700
flop भी होगी और सब कुछ होगा और आप सीखोगे भी

1514
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,740
but हाँ painful

1515
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,380
जदा तो flop ही होता यार because वो

1516
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,600
बहुत महनत जाती है और

1517
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,180
बहुत लोगों की महनत जाती है साथ में

1518
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,700
and it's a little also

1519
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,520
what hurts you is that कि यार एक producer

1520
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,380
ने पैसे लगाय थे

1521
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,660
and वो पैसे वापस

1522
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,680
it wasn't a profitable situation for the producer also

1523
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,580
which you would always want

1524
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,720
that to happen as an actor as a part of that

1525
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,800
film so

1526
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,640
तो कई factors होते हैं जिसके वज़े से आपको बुरा लगता है

1527
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,280
कि यार नहीं चली

1528
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,880
नहीं resonate नहीं कर पाई

1529
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,960
मैं actually आपसे ये सवाल पूछना चाहता हूँ

1530
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,020
जो मैं आप पूछने वाला हूँ

1531
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:25,240
और ये मेरा एक pre-planned सवाल है for this whole podcast

1532
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,560
फिर से थोड़ा सा

1533
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,960
अब आपको पता नहीं ये कैसे मिलेगा आपको

1534
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,180
फिर से reverse engineer कर दो

1535
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,420
फिर आपका step 1 क्या है step 2 क्या है

1536
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,120
और एक game plan draw out करते है

1537
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,840
kudos to engineering drawing

1538
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,480
ये जो तुमने flow chart बना है ना

1539
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,440
इसकी आदत engineering नहीं डाली है

1540
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:54,060
जो words आप use कर रहे हैं

1541
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:55,440
flow chart

1542
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,840
ओके दीज़ा coding nightmare

1543
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,780
nightmare seriously nightmare

1544
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,020
anyway तो ये जो

1545
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,620
flow chart होता है एक

1546
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,140
film industry

1547
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,080
के career को लेकर

1548
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,720
I won't just say film industry के career

1549
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,080
एक hero के career को लेकर

1550
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,900
ये flow chart क्या है

1551
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:15,560
क्योंकि जब

1552
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,780
मैंने YouTube start किया था मुझे लगा हाँ मैं videos

1553
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:20,020
बनाऊंगा and then शायद I'll start a business

1554
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,920
फिर मुझे पता भी नहीं था कि PR जैसी

1555
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,160
चीज़ होती है styling जैसी चीज़ होती है

1556
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,000
इस सब random factors

1557
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,300
ये भी होता है वो A to Z

1558
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:34,820
समझाईए

1559
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:38,260
ये तो पता है नहीं कहां से शुरू करूँ

1560
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,260
काफी चीज़ है थी

1561
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,480
take 20-30 minutes of the answer if you want

1562
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,040
यार पहली बात तो ये है

1563
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,020
कि जैसे 2009 में

1564
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,520
engineering हो गई

1565
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,300
pass out हो गए

1566
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,820
decide कर लिये engineer नहीं बनना अब ये है कि

1567
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,140
actor बनना है करना क्या है चलो पहले सीखते है

1568
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,860
एक official way में सीखते है

1569
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,120
acting school join करते है

1570
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,460
6 महीने acting school किया

1571
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,320
मेरे लिए सबसे बड़ा take away from that school

1572
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,000
was कि यार मुझे जब

1573
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,340
रोज acting करनी पड़ी

1574
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,320
I was a happier person

1575
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,660
I was not cribbing, I was not feeling Monday blues

1576
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:13,900
I was not feeling कि यार आज फिर जाना पड़ रहा है

1577
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,420
I was like okay this is what I can do

1578
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,440
for the rest of my life

1579
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,280
now let's keep evolving in this

1580
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:22,520
one thing I had given कि यार time दूँगा मैं

1581
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,400
and that is something I would say

1582
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,400
an advantage not many people have

1583
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,080
मैं बंबई का ही लड़का हूँ

1584
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,160
मेरा परिवार यहाँ पे है मुझे rent नहीं देना

1585
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,400
सब कुछ तो मैंने का let me make this as an advantage

1586
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,420
rather than just कि यार take it for granted

1587
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,240
so I was like ठीक है

1588
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,780
तो what advantage can I get

1589
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:38,920
give myself time

1590
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,020
मैंने का कोई मुझे जल्दबाजी नहीं है

1591
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,080
camera के सामने आने की

1592
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,300
क्योंकि वो trial and error नहीं होता

1593
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:46,020
वहाँ like we have discussed many times now

1594
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:46,640
KT नहीं है

1595
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,820
judge किया especially in the beginning

1596
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,540
especially in the beginning अगर कि यार इसको काम नहीं आता

1597
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,620
तो दूसरा काम मिलना

1598
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,100
पहला काम ढूढ़ने से भी ज़्यादा मुश्किल हो जाएगा

1599
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,520
मैंने का time low

1600
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:58,820
I got the opportunity to assist Anurag sir

1601
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,920
on Gangs of Basipur

1602
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,960
assist किया that's another story altogether

1603
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,920
कि बहुत कुछ सीखा

1604
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,900
it was like my film school

1605
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,820
बहुत कुछ सीखा

1606
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:08,980
but then what made it more difficult for me

1607
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,600
in the circle of film industry was

1608
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,360
कि सारे मुझे AD की तरह देखने लग गया

1609
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,180
कि ये तो assistant director है

1610
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,360
and usually the assistant directors

1611
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,440
who want to be actors

1612
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,940
उनको थोड़ा ऐसे देखते हैं कि

1613
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:20,820
अच्छा चल ठीक है यार

1614
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:23,060
ठीक है cute

1615
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,500
अब ऐसे देखते हैं

1616
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,600
बट वो और मुश्किल हो जाता है कि आप prove करना है

1617
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,940
कि नहीं यार I actually want to act

1618
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,520
and I like you know take me seriously as an actor

1619
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,500
तो I broke away from that

1620
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,600
कि I was like I was getting more opportunities to assist

1621
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,820
मैंने कहा यार हाथ जोड़के कि नहीं यार ये मैं और करूँगा

1622
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,320
मैं इसी में चला जाओंगा

1623
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,400
and I don't want to be a director I want to be an actor

1624
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,400
मुझे बस समझना था फिल्म कैसी बनती है

1625
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,960
then I started doing theatre

1626
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:47,840
अब वो करना शुरू किया उसके साथ साथ

1627
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,220
मैंने जब finally decided कि आगे

1628
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:51,160
ओडिशन्स देना शुरू करूँगा मुझे काम चाहिए

1629
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,560
as an actor पहली चीज तो ये थी

1630
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,200
कि मुझे पता ही नहीं था कहां

1631
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,400
मिलता है ये काम ओडिशन्स होते

1632
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,260
कहां है और जहां भी मैं

1633
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,060
पहुंचता था ओडिशन्स के लिए पहले देड़ सो लोग

1634
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:31,040
पहुंचे कैसे हैं वहाँ

1635
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:32,780
पहले देड़ की नहीं ऐसे ग्रूप्स बने हुए हैं

1636
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,280
ये बताते हैं वो इंफॉर्मेशन होते हैं

1637
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,340
मैंने कहा अच्छा ये पहले तो ऐसा होता है

1638
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,580
फिर वो ओडिशन्स में ये था कि

1639
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,540
आपको fit भी होना होता है

1640
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,240
ओडिशन के लिए I don't mean physically fit

1641
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,100
कि पहला एक process होता है

1642
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,860
before you crack the audition

1643
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:48,420
you have to crack

1644
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,480
getting into that room full of people

1645
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:52,420
for that audition

1646
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,240
कि पहले knock करके मेरी ये सवाल

1647
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,160
मतलब मैं सपने में भी पूछ सकता था

1648
00:48:57,160 --> 00:48:58,840
am I fit for the audition

1649
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,580
ये अब ऐसा हो गया था कि

1650
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,300
ये जबता था मैं ये

1651
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,880
knock किया am I fit for the audition

1652
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,460
yes लिस्ट पे नाम लेंग दो दो घंटे बाद नंबर आएगा

1653
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,620
am I fit for the audition

1654
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,840
नहीं अगला का है ढूंढो

1655
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,520
तो ये पहले तो ये पता लगा

1656
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,940
कि काम मतलब वो कई बार ऐसा होता था

1657
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,780
genuinely कि audition आज मैं कर दिया

1658
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:18,800
तो मुझे लगता था फिल्म मिल गई

1659
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,140
select भी नहीं हुआ हूँ पर आज audition हो गया यार

1660
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,100
तो वो पहला मेरा एक

1661
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,440
एक bubble तूटा कि भाई क्योंकि acting school में क्या हो जाता है

1662
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
कि 20 लोगों का batch है

1663
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,160
उसमें आप बहुत कमाल थे आपको लगता है बाहर निकलों के

1664
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,220
लाइने लगी होगी सब यही वेट करते हैं कि कब

1665
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,440
विकी कॉशल acting school से निकलेगा और इसको काम देंगे

1666
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:38,300
वो पहला तो bubble burst होता है आपका कि आप 20 लोगों में अच्छे हों

1667
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,700
बाहर 20 लाख लोग वही काम ढूंढ रहे हैं

1668
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,480
तो acting school से सिवा आपका craft polish होता है

1669
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,660
craft polish भी नहीं होता है I would say कि

1670
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:48,540
and it's very subjective to acting schools and it was a great acting school

1671
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:51,100
but मुझे यह था कि it's what you take out of it

1672
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:55,260
they just give you a glimpse and they probably give you the confidence कि

1673
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,440
you have it in you go for it

1674
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,060
but it's a whole world of it's like a Pandora box of skill set

1675
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,140
that you have to learn probably on the job also

1676
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,120
but they just give you the they just open the pores

1677
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,360
कि यार ये समझने की कोशिश करो ये समझने की कोशिश करो

1678
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,680
फिर आप शायद एक wholesome actor बन सकते हो

1679
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,260
और वो रोज आपको कुछ ना कुछ practice करवाएंगे

1680
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:21,300
पहला तो यह था कि audition पर जाना कैसे है

1681
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,240
फिर audition crack करना उसे फिर मिलना नहीं मिलना

1682
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:28,440
काम फिर top 3 में जाके top 2 में जाके आप select नहीं होते हो

1683
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,840
तब मुझे लगता था कि यहाँ और उस समय मतलब

1684
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:35,160
आड में कितने मिलते थे 10,000 per day 15,000 per day

1685
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,220
तो मुझे लगता था यार 10,000 की नौकरी मिलने में में को

1686
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:41,880
मतलब seriously पसीने छोट रहे हैं

1687
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,540
कहाँ और engineering छोड़के no वो बोलने में बड़ा अच्छा लगता है

1688
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,820
कि no plan भी पर तब मुझे genuinely ऐसे पतर रहता है

1689
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,220
जब whatsapp group पे सबके photo आ रहे थे

1690
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,100
my new car, my new flat, my new this

1691
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,320
and you were travelling in buses and rickshaws

1692
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:58,320
कि भाई bank account zero

1693
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:00,020
आप theatre कर रहे हो

1694
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,440
theatre में आपका अंदर का जो actor बड़ा खुश हो रहा है

1695
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,080
क्योंकि रोज आप वो कर रहे हो

1696
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:04,940
what you love doing

1697
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,860
पर आपको पैसे मिल नहीं रहे हैं

1698
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,580
मुझे याद है कि जिस production house में

1699
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,040
मतलब पहली कमाई थी मेरी

1700
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,460
उसमें मुझे 2000 रुपे मिले थे

1701
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:15,540
और मैंको ऐसे था कि

1702
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,860
ये क्या मिल गया मुझे आज 2000 रुपे की

1703
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,320
मैं मतलब लाखों की नौकरी छोड़ के आया था

1704
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,580
पर 2000 रुपे मुझे ऐसा लग रहे थे

1705
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,660
पता नहीं क्या मिल गया मुझे

1706
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:25,880
तो ये सारी चीज़े ना

1707
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,320
नहीं नहीं मुझे समझ में आ रही थी

1708
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,520
पर चलो we started from when I became an actor

1709
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:32,280
की मतलब मौके मिलने लग गये

1710
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,140
तो जब मौका मिला

1711
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,560
और सब कुछ हुआ तो तब

1712
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,500
obviously the things that you mentioned

1713
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,620
कि यार styling or PR

1714
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,460
जैसे for the first 6 months when

1715
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:44,700
Masaan came out, I did not have

1716
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,140
a manager

1717
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:48,340
Masaan आपने कैसे crack करी एसे ही

1718
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:50,900
नहीं मैंने actually जो पहली film shoot की थी

1719
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:52,700
जो मुझे genuinely on the basis of

1720
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,780
audition जो पहला lead role मुझे मिला था

1721
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,760
वो जुबान, Moses Singh was

1722
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,780
the director, it was his first

1723
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,680
film, it was my first film and literally

1724
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,700
he selected after auditioning me

1725
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:04,540
and that was the first film I shot in

1726
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:06,560
2013 but that film

1727
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:08,660
came on like after

1728
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,120
Masaan in 2016

1729
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,540
Masaan was 2015

1730
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,600
so 2016 मैं obviously नई

1731
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,340
film थी कोई किसी को नहीं जानता था, film

1732
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,000
नहीं चली, किसी को पता भी नहीं लगा

1733
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,680
but it was like, वो बहुत special

1734
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,620
film रही गई मेरे लिए because that was like the first thing

1735
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,740
I cracked with the audition कि आप सिलेक्ट हो गया

1736
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,480
पर Masaan

1737
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,080
how I got it was कि

1738
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,700
Neeraj and me, we both ADs on Gangs of

1739
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,620
Wasipur और फिर

1740
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:34,660
he wanted to become a director, I wanted to become an

1741
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,600
actor, so we were like okay अपने अपनी

1742
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:38,600
journey पे करते हैं, but then

1743
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,520
no, he was actually making this film with

1744
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,500
another set of actors, fully

1745
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,080
and he was fully prepped for it तो

1746
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,580
हम actually मिले थे काफी

1747
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,740
महीनों बाद and he was like, what's happening

1748
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,460
क्या हो रहा है तेरी लाइफ में, मेरी लाइफ में क्या हो रहा है

1749
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:52,520
so I said कि यार अभी मैं ये फिल्म shoot करके

1750
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,260
आया हूँ, अब अगला काम ढूंढ रहा हूँ

1751
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,480
and he's like यार मैं ये फिल्म shoot करने वाला हूँ, अब शुरू

1752
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,520
कर रहा हूँ and this is the cast, I was like great यार ये हो

1753
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:00,460
फिर मुझे phone आया

1754
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,500
Mukesh Chhabra का कि

1755
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,160
यार we are casting for that film

1756
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,900
तो मैंने कहा यार

1757
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:08,040
वहाँ तो मुझे, Neeraj से मेरी बात तुझी थी

1758
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:10,160
he showed me the full docket कि यार this is the cast

1759
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,360
and everything, so I don't know what role

1760
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,260
so he's like नहीं यार वो cast अभी हट गई है

1761
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,080
and now there's a vacancy so we are

1762
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,620
looking for a new actor, मैंने कहा अच्छा ठीक है

1763
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:20,220
so I went in and we did

1764
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,880
two scenes as an audition

1765
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,860
एक तो there was a cafeteria scene

1766
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,200
between me and Shweta Tripathi

1767
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,960
and the other scene was ये दुकाई

1768
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,640
खतम नहीं होता

1769
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,040
I did those two scenes और फिर हफते भर

1770
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,480
तक मुझे कोई call नहीं आया

1771
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,280
ना casting से, ना Neeraj से

1772
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,220
Anurag sir से

1773
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,880
was the producer, nobody called

1774
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:41,640
मैंने कहा शायद यार नहीं हो रहा

1775
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:44,080
and I was used to, I was used to not getting a revert

1776
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:44,940
after an audition

1777
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:47,040
मैंने कहा शायद नहीं हो रहा होगा

1778
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,560
but then a week later

1779
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:51,440
Neeraj ने phone किया, रात को साड़े दस बज़े

1780
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,220
sitting with my family

1781
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,060
home and

1782
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:57,220
फिर पहले दस मिनट he's not even

1783
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,540
like mentioning the audition, like it never happens

1784
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,940
तो मुझे लगा शायद

1785
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,100
it's like you know, it's a friend who's like

1786
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,960
kind of, he's gonna reach कि अच्छा यार

1787
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,860
by the way यार that's not working but you know

1788
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:08,880
but then actually

1789
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,100
10-15 minutes बाद he's like

1790
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:12,700
अच्छा by the way यार तू फिल्म कर रहा है

1791
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,800
and I'm like what?

1792
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,760
he's like हाँ हाँ we were just waiting because like you know

1793
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,520
there are 6 producers, everybody had to see

1794
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:20,980
there's a French producer, so the audition tape went to France

1795
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:22,120
and blah blah blah the whole process

1796
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,980
so I was like oh okay, then I started getting calls

1797
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,960
from like Anurag sir and Guneet Monga

1798
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,000
and everybody, कि hey we were just

1799
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,120
waiting for Neeraj to call you and give you the news but da da da

1800
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:32,740
so that's how I

1801
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,940
got मसान

1802
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:35,700
back to the flow chart

1803
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,900
या, so यार

1804
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,900
काफी चीज़ें, like

1805
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,100
जैसे

1806
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,680
जैसे

1807
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:44,060
पर मसान से यह हो गया था कि

1808
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,060
इंडस्ट्री ने फिल्म देखी थी, तब वो लोगों ने

1809
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,980
इतनी नहीं देखी थी, वो आज देख रहे हैं

1810
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,120
कभी OTT पे, कभी कई

1811
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:51,620
पर इंडस्ट्री ने देखी थी तो बहुत

1812
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,680
जैसे screenings होती हैं

1813
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,620
और interviews होते हैं, ये सब नए थे

1814
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,900
क्या बात करनी होती है, क्या नहीं बात करनी होती है

1815
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,640
सब कुछ पता ही नहीं था, like Richa was the

1816
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,200
experienced one, you know

1817
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,960
because Richa was

1818
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,460
also an actor in Gangs of Wasseypur

1819
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:07,600
so there was this that senior वाला

1820
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,280
क्योंकि मैं तो AD था

1821
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,340
तो Wasseypur में, तो मैं वो ही था कि Richa

1822
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,640
मैं तेरा ही हाथ पकड़ूँगा, तो चलते रहना

1823
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,920
साथ में, मुझे समझाते रहना

1824
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,740
so she was very sweet, but

1825
00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:19,120
तो हम समझने की कोशिश ही कर रहे थे, और मसान भी

1826
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,440
बहुत ही college project की तरह बनी थी फिल्म

1827
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,780
बिलकुल पैसे नहीं थे, ऐसी shoot करते थे

1828
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:25,360
या I remember एक दिन

1829
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,680
steady cam था हमारे पास, तो हमको लग रहा था avatar बना रहे हम

1830
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,840
मतलब वो पता नहीं कितनी बड़ी फिल्म बना रहे है

1831
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,280
आज steady cam है, तो हमने decide की था

1832
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,820
आज बैठ के कोई acting नहीं करेगा, आज सब चलेंगे

1833
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,480
चलते चलते acting करेंगे

1834
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,540
तो वो बहुत ही अलग vibe था, हमें नहीं पता था

1835
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,520
release भी होगी, नहीं होगी, DVD फिल्म बन जाएगी

1836
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:40,200
कुछ नहीं पता था

1837
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:43,820
तो मसान हुई, फिर उसके बाद में

1838
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:44,700
ये था कि यार

1839
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:48,180
अच्छा और कैसे काम ढूंढे, क्या करें

1840
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,100
मसान के बाद

1841
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,600
मसान के बाद, मसान के बाद मेरे पहली बार हुआ

1842
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,620
कि मुझे script आने लगी थोड़ी सी

1843
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,500
but every script would be based on a

1844
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,820
UP based character, UP boy

1845
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,860
तो हर character

1846
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,120
वही बनारस से ही था

1847
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:03,460
तो मैंने कहा नहीं यार, ये तो

1848
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,860
मतलब मुझे वो नहीं करना है, मेरे अंदर और भी है

1849
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,460
जो मुझे लगता है, अब मैं बहुत नया हूँ

1850
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,460
शायद नहीं भी है, but let me explore

1851
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:10,360
let me wait it out

1852
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,360
मसान हुँने के बाद कोई 6-8 मेंने मैंने काम नहीं किया

1853
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,020
और ना मिला, क्योंकि

1854
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,260
जो आ रहा था, वो वही था, मसान के

1855
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,440
मेलिउ का था, जो मुझे करना नहीं था

1856
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,140
और फिर

1857
00:56:21,140 --> 00:56:21,780
I think

1858
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,980
अनुराग सर से ही आया मुझे, कि यार

1859
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,960
रामन रागव के लिए

1860
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,320
where

1861
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:31,340
he said, अच्छा क्या कराए, remember I was at पृत्वी थेटर

1862
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:32,880
मैं कोई शो देखने गया था, and he said

1863
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:35,560
एक मैं को screen test लेना है तेरा

1864
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,320
I think

1865
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,620
you are not fit for the part, that's how he started

1866
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,320
but I, somehow

1867
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,380
I feel like I should test you and see

1868
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:44,380
if you have it in you

1869
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,420
and it was like a cop's role and very

1870
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:49,120
like a very dark film and

1871
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,200
it was fully opposite from like

1872
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,420
from who I was, I have lived a very

1873
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,480
protected upbringing, जो मेरी

1874
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,360
रही है, family, you know

1875
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:59,380
no kind of, no complexities

1876
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:00,260
as such

1877
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,840
तो एक simple सी

1878
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,020
life रही है और उस

1879
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:07,060
character के complexities बहुत थे

1880
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:09,340
This is something I don't understand about you

1881
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,280
What? कि

1882
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,760
you are genuinely a very simple guy

1883
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,440
पता चल जाता है किसी को भी, if they listen to you

1884
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,120
but

1885
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,980
the characters you play and your performances are very

1886
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,200
layered and complex, I don't know how you

1887
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,000
are able to do that, I don't know man

1888
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,180
I don't know, but

1889
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,920
but yeah, but

1890
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,420
उसका audition हुआ

1891
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:30,240
उसमें फिर I was like, यार मैं क्या

1892
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,100
करूँ, मुझे पता भी नहीं था मैं क्या करना है

1893
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,720
इसके लिए मैं कैसे समझूँ

1894
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:35,720
there's this, like you know

1895
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,440
he has this hate against his father

1896
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:40,640
his upbringing, he's got so much

1897
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,580
angst and resentment inside him

1898
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,460
that he's like, he doesn't know when he goes

1899
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,120
this side of the line or that side of the line

1900
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:47,920
he doesn't know where he is, but he's a cop

1901
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,460
so मैंने का यार

1902
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,180
and I was what, 26 at that time

1903
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:53,360
so

1904
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,700
I was kind of like, जो भी करके मैंने audition दिया

1905
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,640
and he said कि यार नहीं ये नहीं ये नहीं

1906
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,760
but then he's like, no but I saw something

1907
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,680
in your eyes where I feel I can take you

1908
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,200
to the character

1909
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,780
I was like, okay, then I did that thing

1910
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,700
but which to till date I feel

1911
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,800
like that's my worst performance, like Raman Raghav

1912
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:11,980
I feel like

1913
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,640
like not because I said like performance performance

1914
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,640
but I feel कि यार मैंने अपनी life

1915
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,200
उतनी नहीं जीती जितना उस character की requirement थी

1916
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:20,660
it is not just कि

1917
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,480
costume पहन के वैसे expressions दे दो

1918
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,200
और वैसे dialogue honestly बोल दो

1919
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,040
conviction के साथ

1920
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,720
but some characters require you to live a certain life also

1921
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,280
that was one of them

1922
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,120
मुझे ऐसा लगता है कि आज अगर मुझे

1923
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,080
वो opportunity मिले तो मैं कुछ और पहलू

1924
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,960
उसमें दे सकता हूँ and in fact every

1925
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,660
five years if I get that opportunity again

1926
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,300
I'll bring you something else to that role

1927
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:42,260
it was just the role was that kind of

1928
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,160
dimension to it

1929
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,260
then of course

1930
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,900
film दर film I don't know how to kind of

1931
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,580
see कि क्या क्या सीखा बट

1932
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:52,120
छोटे छोटे चीज़ें कई बार ये होता था

1933
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,940
कि अच्छे ये PR, PR came very late

1934
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,860
into my life कि ये क्या होता है

1935
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,840
कि you know and आज तक like I'm not a very

1936
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,040
PR friendly person because

1937
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,860
मुझे लगता है कि यार काम बोलेगा ना

1938
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:03,200
यार अब उसमें मैं क्या

1939
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:04,220
क्या बोलना है मुझे

1940
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,000
go tell the Instagram algorithm that

1941
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,040
no but but seriously like I understand

1942
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,080
when you have work and you want to push that work ahead

1943
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,080
I understand that

1944
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,920
but they have a very difficult time with me

1945
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:22,400
because

1946
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:25,380
they like come with ideas

1947
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,340
and I'm like पागल हो गया क्या कर रहे हो यार

1948
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,200
मुझे बड़ी शरम आती है मैंने कहा

1949
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,620
यार ये क्या कर रहे हो ये यार

1950
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,220
अच्छा काम पहुंच जाता है

1951
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,400
can I give you a PR angle

1952
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,160
I have a marketing company as well

1953
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,640
so I know what I'm talking about

1954
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,820
I feel you should do more podcasts in general

1955
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,320
और ये मैं podcast के लिए नहीं कह रहा हूँ

1956
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,260
ये मैं कह रहा हूँ

1957
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,920
I've never done podcasts

1958
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,240
I think I might have done on a smaller scale

1959
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,620
but this is the first proper one

1960
00:59:48,620 --> 00:59:50,360
I don't mean you do one every month

1961
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,860
but at least do one every year

1962
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:53,180
and go on different podcasts if you want

1963
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:53,700
अच्छा

1964
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:57,020
बट आप बहुत smart हो

1965
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,480
और आप communicate कर पाते हो

1966
00:59:59,480 --> 00:59:59,720
okay

1967
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,000
this is all you need for the show

1968
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,420
for shows like this

1969
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,020
मनाम जो आपके दिमाग के अंदर है

1970
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,420
you are able to explain to an engineering junior

1971
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:08,360
एक्जाम में ये कर ले

1972
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:10,780
बट

1973
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,480
ये सारी चीज़ें है

1974
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:13,980
जैसे

1975
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,620
I suck at

1976
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,760
marketing

1977
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:20,460
I suck at doing PR

1978
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,140
or whatever

1979
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,420
I love it when a film comes out

1980
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,060
and my work is like doing the talking

1981
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,240
I love that, I find confidence in that

1982
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,360
I feel like a certain strength in that

1983
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,640
I am assuming कि आपने craft पर काम किया

1984
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,000
डिरेक्टर के साथ

1985
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,800
बैट कर सीखा

1986
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:36,940
आक्टिंग के बार में और

1987
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,840
हर डिरेक्टर से आपने बहुत कुछ सीखा

1988
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,120
उसके बाद

1989
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,760
हिट फिल्म्स के

1990
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,140
आने के बाद आपकी लाइफ में

1991
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,080
आपने ये सब

1992
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,180
PR, Styling इन साइज चीज़ों के बार में सीख लिया

1993
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:52,120
या, वो भी सीख रहा हूँ

1994
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,740
मैं ये नहीं कहूँगा सीख लिया

1995
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,420
और सीख रहा हूँ

1996
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,540
लेकिन

1997
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,560
हाँ

1998
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:01,320
सीख रहा हूँ

1999
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,540
ये एक बहुत famous चीज़ है कि आप

2000
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:05,040
ड्रिंक नहीं करते, स्मोक नहीं करते

2001
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,580
जब मैंने

2002
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,240
रमन रागव

2003
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:11,460
made me a smoker because

2004
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,880
उसमें बहुत हर scene में

2005
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:15,060
हर इसमें करना था

2006
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,020
and I was like while I was shooting that film

2007
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:19,080
I was probably smoking like two packets

2008
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:21,200
a day or something because it was just like

2009
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,000
लंबे लंबे shots and that's the

2010
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,760
first time I was smoking I was like क्या करा रहे हो सर

2011
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:27,060
but obviously I had

2012
01:01:27,060 --> 01:01:29,080
to quit like I quit that after the film

2013
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,780
and फिर

2014
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,120
drinking शुरू

2015
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:34,140
में बिल्कुल नहीं था like

2016
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,900
मसान के वक्त when I had

2017
01:01:36,900 --> 01:01:38,780
for that scene वो तब scene के लिए था

2018
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,880
but now it's like very occasionally like

2019
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,800
या कि या दोस की शादी है और ये वो like

उसके वाज़े से आपको काम मिल जाएगा कभी नहीं होगा नहीं होगा आपको काम आता है तो ही काम मिलेगा

2023
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,660
Of course, if you've reached out to them in their offices and met them in their offices

2024
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,920
and you build that sort of a relationship that listen I want to work with you and this and that

2025
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,720
then you become friends, of course, that's a different story altogether.

2026
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,880
But just that एक बीच मिश्म में हूँ क्योंकि ये भी मैं शुरू में बहुत देखता था

2027
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,060
कि यार मैं उस party में जाना चाहता हूँ और यहां जाना चाहता हूँ

2028
01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:29,580
so that I'll get to meet that guy and that's how I'll get to work.

2029
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:59,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2030
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:29,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2031
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:59,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2032
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:29,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2033
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:59,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2034
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:29,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2035
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:59,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2036
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:29,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2037
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:59,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2038
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:29,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2039
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:59,560
कुछ नहीं होता

2040
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:04,300
everything i've seen her like she is disciplined like i've not seen like many people being disciplined

2041
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:10,700
and i have really uh learned that a lot from her uh because when it comes to like you know when

2042
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:16,860
like there's this sequence coming or there's this that coming she goes mental like five months back

2043
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:21,980
before that and she's like her diet changes this changes that changes and then i realized

2044
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:28,860
she's achieved that reputation when it comes to certain things because she's she puts in that work

2045
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:32,620
until date and that's what stimulates her uh she doesn't do it with an attitude

2046
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:40,140
she's like then super unemotional about it like you got to do what you got to do and that i've

2047
01:09:40,140 --> 01:09:44,220
like i've i've really like kind of that helps me sometimes as a reminder that you know

2048
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:48,540
just you got to do what you got to do uh if you really want the rewards for that

2049
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:53,260
uh and that is something uh remarkable about her cricket yeah okay

2050
01:09:57,740 --> 01:09:58,620
it's not as simple as

2051
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:01,500
mental game separates the best mental side

2052
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:22,940
a little brutal question for you how does it feel to be vicky kaushal right now because

2053
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:28,700
from an external perspective your career is flying how does it feel it's great

2054
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:31,500
it's great he's great because um

2055
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:46,300
audition but now when you look back and it

2056
01:10:55,020 --> 01:10:58,700
and you don't you you like uh i i've

2057
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:01,160
like hold it to my chest like that

2058
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,120
कि यार ये इसको बढ़ाना ही है

2059
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:04,520
इसको कम नहीं करना है

2060
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:07,200
if I today say that

2061
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:09,320
Sam Bahadur is the toughest

2062
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,260
role I've done, I want to change that

2063
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:13,260
in my next film, I want to be

2064
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:15,280
able to say that no, you know what, I've topped that

2065
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,760
this is my toughest role now

2066
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,140
and I want to keep pushing myself

2067
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,080
to that level, success होता है फिलिए

2068
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:23,160
वो मेरे हाथ में ही नहीं है, but at least

2069
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,240
I want to feel that I gave it so much

2070
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,800
कि हाँ success की गुणजाईश है

2071
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,460
तो वो तो मुझे करना ही है

2072
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:31,320
तो अभी जो हूँ, जैसा भी

2073
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:33,360
जो भी चल रहा है life में, firstly there's a lot

2074
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,400
of gratitude because

2075
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,280
कभी नहीं सोचा था यार, छोटे-छोटे role से

2076
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,340
शुरू किया था, तो अब जब भी

2077
01:11:39,340 --> 01:11:41,360
ऐसे मौके मिल रहे हैं, इतना audience का प्यार मिल रहा है

2078
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:43,180
तो बहुत अच्छा लगता है, और

2079
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:45,300
तुम्हें लगता है कि यार, ये बहुत-बहुत

2080
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,720
special है, you know, इसको safeguard करो

2081
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,320
each and every person

2082
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:51,300
coming to me for a selfie or an autograph

2083
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,060
means the world to me

2084
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:53,880
because

2085
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,700
I have walked on the streets

2086
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,300
not anybody

2087
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:01,100
knowing me and I wanted to change that

2088
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:03,380
and now that it's changed, I don't want

2089
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:04,700
like, I want more of it

2090
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:07,340
and मुझे कई बार पूछा भी जाता है

2091
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:08,900
कि यार, don't you get tired

2092
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,240
and people who are coming to me for selfies and they've seen me for

2093
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,980
10 minutes कि यार, ठीक है, हाँ, ये कर रहा था

2094
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:15,340
they only ask, कि यार, I'm tired for that

2095
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:17,320
मैंने कहा, नहीं यार, there's something I was

2096
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,300
doing for many years that, that was tiring

2097
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,820
for me to

2098
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,980
get this from you, so I want

2099
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:24,520
like, I want 24 hours of this

2100
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:27,280
so, it's a good feeling

2101
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:28,740
it's a feeling of gratitude and

2102
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:31,240
and it motivates me

2103
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,760
also, यार, this time that is going on

2104
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,460
परियर को लेकर खुद का goal क्या है?

2105
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:36,640
What do you mean?

2106
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,800
कहां तक लेकर जाना चाओगे?

2107
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:39,420
गोल क्या है?

2108
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:41,700
यार,

2109
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:44,140
जहां तक हो सके, यार

2110
01:12:44,140 --> 01:12:46,920
I have not put a finish line for myself

2111
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:48,860
it's like, like

2112
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:51,000
that checkered flag is a mirage

2113
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,680
for me, I wanted to be there

2114
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,060
but I don't want to reach there because

2115
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,840
you know, as they say that the wolf climbing

2116
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,780
the hill is always hungrier than the wolf

2117
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,680
on the hill, so I want to be the wolf

2118
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,760
climbing the hill and I want to keep seeing that peak

2119
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,960
and the peak I should never reach

2120
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,620
because every time I, you know, once you

2121
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,400
reach there, you've reached there, now what?

2122
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,580
You're going to come down only, you know, or you stay there

2123
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:12,220
but I just want to keep climbing

2124
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,700
so goal is something

2125
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,840
that I'll probably set a new goal every year

2126
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:18,520
every phase, every few years

2127
01:13:18,520 --> 01:13:20,520
but I just, whatever

2128
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:21,480
the

2129
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:24,640
limits are for this profession

2130
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,000
or whatever, I want to

2131
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,740
achieve them all

2132
01:13:27,740 --> 01:13:29,540
Success metric है आपका?

2133
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:32,280
नहीं यार, रात को बेट पर नीद अच्छी है

2134
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:33,880
but it's daily success metric

2135
01:13:33,880 --> 01:13:36,560
and that is a very holistic

2136
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:38,220
success metric because success

2137
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:40,380
is not just for me, it's not just the job

2138
01:13:40,380 --> 01:13:42,760
it's for me as a husband

2139
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,660
it's for me as a son, it's for me as a brother

2140
01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,820
it's for me as an actor, it's for me

2141
01:13:46,820 --> 01:13:48,320
as a public figure, it's for me as

2142
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,720
everything put together, I need to

2143
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,320
feel successful

2144
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:53,440
not just as an actor

2145
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,240
और इस जर्नी में, अपल क्लाम में

2146
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:56,960
trade-off क्या है?

2147
01:14:02,460 --> 01:14:03,220
Social life

2148
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:09,480
शायद

2149
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,560
not

2150
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,780
I won't say like friendship

2151
01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:15,580
but

2152
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,940
उतना मिल नहीं पाता है जितना आप चाहोगे

2153
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:18,780
Pure friendship

2154
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:22,440
प्यॉर फ्रेंशिप तो रह जाती है, that's not dependent on the number of times you meet them

2155
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,400
or talk to them

2156
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,420
नहीं, मैं कह रहा हूँ, lack of new pure friendship

2157
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:29,300
नहीं, I feel like

2158
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,140
वो new pure, when you're saying pure

2159
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,560
it's a very like, I'm meaning pure

2160
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:35,100
प्यॉर फ्रेंशिप्स वो

2161
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:37,400
इतने regularly होते भी नहीं है, किसी के भी life में

2162
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,720
वो आते हैं और फिर आते हैं और रह जाते हैं

2163
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:41,760
और वो अपने आप होते हैं, वो organically होते हैं

2164
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,800
वो तुम plan नहीं करते हो

2165
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,460
तो you are also not prepared कि अच्छा ये pure होने वाला है

2166
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:46,400
पर ये हो जाता है

2167
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,560
So वो तो जब होना है वो होगा ही

2168
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,480
वो तो वो कोई रोक नहीं सकता

2169
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,380
But I feel कि हाँ जब

2170
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:54,720
जैसे like my college friends

2171
01:14:54,720 --> 01:14:55,980
जो engineering friends है सारे

2172
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:58,300
I love them to bits

2173
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,740
and that really is

2174
01:15:00,740 --> 01:15:01,860
like one part of my

2175
01:15:01,860 --> 01:15:04,520
life which I can call like truly like family

2176
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:06,200
which they are

2177
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,600
but I sometimes don't get to meet

2178
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,000
them as much as I would want to

2179
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,040
spend time with them as much as I would want to

2180
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:13,760
and so many times I like

2181
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,920
like really feel

2182
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:16,440
four mode

2183
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,320
I

2184
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:20,060
can't I'm not there or whatever

2185
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:22,540
but that's a very small price you pay

2186
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:24,380
and thank god that they are

2187
01:15:24,380 --> 01:15:26,720
true friends because they understand

2188
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,600
This is what you mean by

2189
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,000
social life, lack of social life

2190
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,740
Just this factor

2191
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:32,860
कि bros के साथ

2192
01:15:32,860 --> 01:15:36,780
The true social circle

2193
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:38,240
मेरा बहुत चोटा है

2194
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:39,660
बहुत चोटा है

2195
01:15:39,660 --> 01:15:42,720
It's like my family and these friends and a few friends from the industry

2196
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:44,800
बट उसकी लवा

2197
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,280
जो social life है वगेरा वगेरा

2198
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:47,200
वो तो चल ठीक है यार

2199
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,100
वो तो आएगा जाएगा कुछ करोगे

2200
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,060
आप अटेंड कुछ नहीं करोगे

2201
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,120
वो देखाई दिफरेंट स्टोरी

2202
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:53,020
Are you comfortable naming who from the industry?

2203
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,840
Yeah, there's

2204
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:56,880
Amritpal Singh Bindra, there's Anant Tiwari

2205
01:15:56,880 --> 01:15:58,620
He's a director

2206
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,280
I've gone for his drama

2207
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:02,260
coaching when I was a kid

2208
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:05,600
He had directed these two guys

2209
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,260
I met them during Love Per Square Foot

2210
01:16:07,260 --> 01:16:09,280
and Anant's wife Angira who was my

2211
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:09,740
co-star

2212
01:16:09,740 --> 01:16:12,660
These guys are like family

2213
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:17,180
यह है और शायद एक दो और है

2214
01:16:17,180 --> 01:16:19,460
जो मुझे नहीं आ रहे दमाग में

2215
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,960
but there are a few people

2216
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,060
Okay, Vicky Kaushal

2217
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,060
मैं बस यह कहना चाहूँगा कि you are the shan of

2218
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,380
Indian engineering students

2219
01:16:26,380 --> 01:16:31,000
This was a lot of fun

2220
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,280
talking to you, honestly

2221
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:35,240
I hope you also had fun bro

2222
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:36,820
Wow, these are the closing lines?

2223
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:37,700
Yeah, yeah

2224
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:41,140
For me also, it's like

2225
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:42,960
it's fun for me where I feel like

2226
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:43,940
I had a genuine chat

2227
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:47,000
where like you know it's not a

2228
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:47,160
present

2229
01:16:47,180 --> 01:16:49,320
presentation of who I am

2230
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,280
what I am, what film is coming up or whatever

2231
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:53,120
it's just, we're just having a

2232
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,480
conversation and

2233
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:57,180
hope, like I'm sure that's how it's gonna

2234
01:16:57,180 --> 01:16:57,740
reach them but

2235
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:00,960
it was like, it really was

2236
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,520
fantastic being here and

2237
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,900
connecting to you and

2238
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:06,860
connecting to your viewers through the show

2239
01:17:06,860 --> 01:17:09,120
and I'm just very

2240
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,260
thankful for having

2241
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,140
me on the show so thank you for that

2242
01:17:13,140 --> 01:17:15,040
No, I have some last things to tell you

2243
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:15,800
not to ask you

2244
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:16,060
Okay

2245
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:16,500
Okay

2246
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:16,800
Okay

2247
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:17,840
So

2248
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,740
through every podcast

2249
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:20,680
I know about my guests

2250
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:21,760
Okay

2251
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,880
The whole intention of the show is to get into your heart

2252
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:25,300
rather than just your mind

2253
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,440
What I said at the start

2254
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,540
and I know you're aware of this

2255
01:17:29,540 --> 01:17:30,820
but maybe I'm just repeating myself

2256
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:33,000
You're a very very blessed human

2257
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,140
You're definitely hardworking

2258
01:17:36,140 --> 01:17:37,500
you're disciplined, you're a thinker

2259
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:38,420
you're an engineering grad

2260
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,740
but along with that there's a big role of

2261
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,840
destiny in your life

2262
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,140
Very very big role

2263
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:47,140
to get selected for a particular podcast

2264
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:47,860
100%

2265
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:49,120
Even from the start

2266
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:50,120
100%.

2267
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:51,020
Even when you say about Masaan

2268
01:17:51,020 --> 01:17:53,720
why were you the AD with the actual director

2269
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:54,160
Yeah

2270
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:57,520
So there's too much destiny that's gone into your life

2271
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,760
and it's very obvious even from the outside

2272
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,680
This is what I knew about you before I actually spoke to you today

2273
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,760
So I'm just very

2274
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:08,260
I won't say curious

2275
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:11,700
I'm very happy and excited to see that hill that you're climbing on

2276
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:15,400
Because maybe you don't want to look at the chequered line

2277
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:16,780
and maybe there's no chequered line but we can like, see it

2278
01:18:16,780 --> 01:18:17,140
And there's no chequered line but we can like, see it

2279
01:18:17,140 --> 01:18:17,160
And there's no chequered line and maybe there's no chequered line but we can like, see it
